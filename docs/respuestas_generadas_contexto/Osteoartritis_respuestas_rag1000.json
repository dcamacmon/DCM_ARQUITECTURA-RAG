Patient participants on the Patient and Voting Panels raised the concern that patients who are in pain might be hesitant to participate in exercise. There is no uniformly accepted level of pain at which a patient should or should not exercise, and a common-sense approach of shared decision-making between the treating clinician and the patient regarding when to initiate an exercise program is advisable. However, clinical trials of exercise for OA include patients with pain and functional limitations due to OA, and improvements in OA-specific outcomes have been demonstrated; thus, results are likely to be generalizable to most patients with pain due to OA. Although there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend one form of exercise over another, patients will likely benefit from advice that is as",

        "respuesta": "A multimodal treatment plan is preferred over a single medication approach for managing osteoarthritis because it addresses the broader impact of osteoarthritis and its comorbidities on the patient. This approach allows for the consideration of various factors such as mood disorders, altered sleep patterns, chronic widespread pain, and impaired coping skills, which can significantly affect the overall well-being of the patient. By incorporating multiple interventions aimed at improving mood, reducing stress, addressing insomnia, managing weight, and enhancing fitness, a multimodal treatment plan may lead to better treatment success. Additionally, a multimodal approach may be more effective in managing chronic pain and providing comprehensive care for the patient.",

Important directions for research include gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the optimal types of exercises and the modifications that should be used based on disease location and severity, study of the intensity of exercise that would be optimal for a given individual ( https ://health.gov/pagui In conclusion, optimal management requires a comprehensive, multimodal approach to treating patients with hand, hip, and/ or knee OA offered in the context of shared decision-making with patients, to choose the safest and most effective treatment possible.

For some patients with more limited disease in whom medication is required, topical NSAIDs represent an appropriate first choice. For others, particularly with hip OA or polyarticular involvement, oral NSAIDs are more appropriate. The appropriate use of other oral agents, particularly acetaminophen and opioids, will continue to evolve Despite the many options available, some patients may continue to experience inadequate symptom control; others will experience adverse effects from the available interventions.
