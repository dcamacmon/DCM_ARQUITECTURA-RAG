Fracture prevention data in GIOP is currently limited to oral BP and PTH. Anabolic agents may be the preferred initial therapy for those at very high risk for fracture based on BMD and vertebral fracture prevention superiority compared to anti-resorptives in patients with very high risk postmenopausal OP. Of note, abaloparatide and ROM are not approved in GIOP, and we recognize it may be difficult to access these medications for GIOP.

New information supports a shift from the paradigm of discon tinuing all RMD medications except prednisone, since pregnancy-compatible steroid-sparing disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologic agents pose fewer short-and long-term risks to mother and infant. With adequate planning, treatment, and monitoring, most women with RMD can have successful pregnancies. Recent data indicate compatibility of many rheumatology medications both with lactation and with paternal use. The rheumatologist's familiarity with drug safety during these periods is important to maintain disease control and minimize mother and infant risk. Fertility and postmenopausal issues are not uncommon in RMD patients. Recommendations regarding ART reflect a growing demand among patients with RMD for fertility therapies.
