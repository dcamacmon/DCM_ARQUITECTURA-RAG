        "pregunta": "1. What is the recommended treatment for adults with nonradiographic axial SpA who have active disease despite NSAID treatment?",
        "respuesta": "The recommended treatment for adults with nonradiographic axial SpA who have active disease despite NSAID treatment is to consider treatment with biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) or interleukin-17 inhibitors. These medications have been shown to be effective in reducing inflammation and improving symptoms in patients with axial SpA. It is important to consult with a rheumatologist to determine the most appropriate treatment plan based on individual patient factors."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "2. When should treatment with TNFi be considered in adults with nonradiographic axial SpA?",
        "respuesta": "Treatment with TNFi should be considered in adults with nonradiographic axial SpA who have persistent symptoms despite adequate treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for at least 3 months. Additionally, TNFi therapy may be initiated in patients with high disease activity, significant functional impairment, or elevated inflammatory markers. Early intervention with TNFi has been shown to improve symptoms, function, and quality of life in patients with nonradiographic axial SpA."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "3. What are the recommended medications for adults with active nonradiographic axial SpA who have contraindications to TNFi?",
        "respuesta": "For adults with active nonradiographic axial SpA who have contraindications to TNFi (tumor necrosis factor inhibitors), the recommended medications may include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen, corticosteroids, and non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) like sulfasalazine. Physical therapy and exercise are also important components of treatment for nonradiographic axial SpA. It is important for patients to work closely with their healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate treatment plan based on their individual needs and circumstances."

        "pregunta": "4. In adults with isolated active sacroiliitis despite NSAID treatment, what is the recommended approach for glucocorticoid treatment?",
        "respuesta": "In adults with isolated active sacroiliitis despite NSAID treatment, the recommended approach for glucocorticoid treatment is to consider intra-articular corticosteroid injections directly into the affected sacroiliac joint. This targeted approach can help reduce inflammation and pain in the joint, providing relief for the patient."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "5. What is the recommendation regarding physical therapy for adults with nonradiographic axial SpA?",
        "respuesta": "Physical therapy is recommended for adults with nonradiographic axial SpA as it can help improve flexibility, strength, and overall function. Specific exercises and stretches tailored to the individual's needs can help reduce pain, improve mobility, and prevent further progression of the condition. Additionally, physical therapy can also help individuals learn proper posture and body mechanics to manage symptoms and improve quality of life."

    {
        "pregunta": "6. When should treatment with biologics be discontinued in adults with nonradiographic axial SpA?",
        "respuesta": "Treatment with biologics should be discontinued in adults with nonradiographic axial SpA if there is no significant improvement in symptoms or if the patient experiences intolerable side effects. Additionally, discontinuation may be considered if the patient achieves sustained remission or low disease activity for an extended period of time. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before making any decisions about discontinuing biologic treatment."

    {
        "pregunta": "7. What is the recommendation regarding the use of CRP concentrations or ESR monitoring in adults with nonradiographic axial SpA?",
        "respuesta": "The recommendation regarding the use of CRP concentrations or ESR monitoring in adults with nonradiographic axial SpA is that regular monitoring of these inflammatory markers may be helpful in assessing disease activity, response to treatment, and predicting disease progression. However, these markers should not be used in isolation and should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical symptoms and imaging findings for a comprehensive evaluation of the disease."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "8. What is the recommended approach for assessing disease activity in adults with nonradiographic axial SpA?",
        "respuesta": "The recommended approach for assessing disease activity in adults with nonradiographic axial SpA is to use a combination of clinical assessment, patient-reported outcomes, and imaging studies such as MRI. This comprehensive approach helps to evaluate the symptoms experienced by the patient, their functional limitations, and any inflammation or damage present in the spine or sacroiliac joints. Regular monitoring of disease activity using these methods can help guide treatment decisions and ensure optimal management of the condition."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "9. In adults with nonradiographic axial SpA of unclear activity while on a biologic, what imaging study is recommended?",
        "respuesta": "In adults with nonradiographic axial SpA of unclear activity while on a biologic, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended to assess inflammation and disease activity in the spine and sacroiliac joints."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "10. What is the recommended approach for obtaining repeat spine radiographs in adults with active or stable nonradiographic axial SpA?",
        "respuesta": "The recommended approach for obtaining repeat spine radiographs in adults with active or stable nonradiographic axial SpA is to follow the guidelines set by the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International Society (ASAS). According to ASAS recommendations, repeat spine radiographs should be obtained every 2 years to monitor disease progression and assess for new structural changes. It is important to work closely with a healthcare provider who is knowledgeable about axial SpA to determine the appropriate timing and frequency of repeat radiographs based on the individual's specific clinical presentation and disease activity."
