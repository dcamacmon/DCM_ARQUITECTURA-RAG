The decision on whether patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate should escalate to a bDMARD, tsDMARD, or triple therapy engendered much discussion with contrasting points of view. In the end, a recommendation was made in favor of a bDMARD or tsDMARD because of the more rapid onset of benefit and concerns related to the poor tolerability and durability of triple therapy in real-world practice Members of the voting panel agreed with the patient panel on the direction and strength of all but 2 recommendations. Patients were in favor of initial treatment with combination csD-MARDs over methotrexate monotherapy because they placed greater value on the incremental benefits associated with combination therapy compared to clinicians.
