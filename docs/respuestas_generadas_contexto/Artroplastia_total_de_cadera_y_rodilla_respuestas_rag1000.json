Patients who have radiographically moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis or advanced symptomatic osteonecrosis with secondary arthritis, along with moderate-to-severe pain and loss of function, are suitable candidates for elective total hip or knee arthroplasty.\n2. Decision-making regarding the timing of surgery should involve a shared decision-making process between the patient and their physician, considering the patient's preferences, medical history, and treatment goals.\n3. Patients should have completed and not improved with at least one trial of appropriate nonoperative therapy, such as physical therapy, NSAIDs, and/or intraarticular injections, before considering elective arthroplasty.\n4. The guideline emphasizes the importance of individualized assessment of patients based on standard radiographic grading, pain level, functional limitations, and previous treatment responses to determine the optimal timing for surgery.\n\nThese guiding principles aim to ensure that patients receive the most appropriate and effective treatment for their condition based on their specific clinical circumstances and treatment history.",

        "pregunta": "9. Why is proceeding to TJA without delay recommended over delaying TJA for patients with bone loss with deformity or severe ligamentous instability in the defined population?",
        "respuesta": "The rationale behind recommending proceeding to total joint arthroplasty without delay over delaying surgery for patients with bone loss with deformity or severe ligamentous instability in the defined population is based on several factors:\n\n1. Increased risk of instability and complications: Patients with severe bone loss, deformity, or severe ligamentous instability are at increased risk of joint instability, functional limitations, and complications if surgery is delayed. Delaying surgery may further exacerbate these issues, leading to worsened outcomes and increasing the technical difficulty of the procedure.\n\n2. Impact on surgical outcomes: Delaying total joint arthroplasty for patients with significant bone loss or deformity does not necessarily improve surgical outcomes. In fact, postponing surgery may result in more challenging procedures, increased risk of revision or reoperation, and decreased long-term success rates.\n\n3. Patient safety and quality of life: Timely total joint arthroplasty in cases of bone loss with deformity or severe ligamentous instability is essential for maintaining or improving patient safety, quality of life, and functional outcomes. Proceeding with surgery without delay can help address the underlying issues effectively and prevent further progression of the condition.\n\n4. Expert opinion and clinical experience: The recommendation to proceed with total joint arthroplasty without delay is based on expert opinion and clinician experiences in managing patients with bone loss, deformity, or severe ligamentous instability. While the evidence may be limited, the guidance is informed by the collective knowledge and best practices of healthcare providers in this specific population.\n\nOverall, the recommendation to proceed to total joint arthroplasty without delay for patients with bone loss, deformity, or severe ligamentous instability aims to optimize patient outcomes, reduce complications, and improve quality of life for individuals in need of surgical intervention.",

            "In these patients, delaying TJA may lead to increased instability and increased juxtaarticular bone loss or deformity, which may increase the technical difficulty of the procedure as well as increase the risk of failure and need for revision. Although patients who have severe bone loss, deformity, or instability have an increased risk of revision or reoperation, this risk will likely only increase over time, with further delay in surgery.
