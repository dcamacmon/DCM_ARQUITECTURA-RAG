        "pregunta": "1. What is the recommended frequency for screening people with SLE for proteinuria in the absence of known kidney disease?",
        "respuesta": "The recommended frequency for screening people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) for proteinuria in the absence of known kidney disease is every 3-6 months. This is important for early detection of kidney involvement, which is a common complication of SLE. Regular monitoring can help in timely intervention and management of kidney disease in patients with SLE."

        "pregunta": "2. When is a kidney biopsy strongly recommended in people with SLE suspected of having lupus nephritis?",
        "respuesta": "A kidney biopsy is strongly recommended in people with SLE suspected of having lupus nephritis when there is evidence of significant proteinuria, elevated serum creatinine levels, or uncontrolled hypertension despite appropriate treatment. This procedure is essential for accurately diagnosing and staging lupus nephritis, guiding treatment decisions, and assessing the extent of kidney damage."

        "pregunta": "3. What is the preferred therapy regimen for lupus nephritis according to the ACR guideline?",
        "respuesta": "The preferred therapy regimen for lupus nephritis according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline involves a combination of immunosuppressive medications, such as corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, or calcineurin inhibitors. This treatment approach aims to reduce inflammation and prevent further kidney damage in patients with lupus nephritis."

        "pregunta": "4. How should medication dosages be adjusted in individuals with decreased GFR at the initiation of lupus nephritis therapy?",
        "respuesta": "Medication dosages should be adjusted in individuals with decreased GFR at the initiation of lupus nephritis therapy by reducing the dose or increasing the dosing interval of certain medications to prevent accumulation and potential toxicity. It is important to closely monitor kidney function and adjust dosages accordingly to ensure safe and effective treatment."

        "pregunta": "5. When should adjunctive treatment with systemic anticoagulation be considered for individuals with lupus nephritis?",
        "respuesta": "Adjunctive treatment with systemic anticoagulation should be considered for individuals with lupus nephritis when they have a high risk of thrombotic events, such as those with a history of thrombosis, antiphospholipid antibodies, or nephrotic syndrome. Systemic anticoagulation may help prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of complications in these high-risk patients."

    {
        "pregunta": "6. What is the recommended duration of therapy for individuals who have achieved sustained complete renal response after treatment with immunosuppressive therapy?",
        "respuesta": "The recommended duration of therapy for individuals who have achieved sustained complete renal response after treatment with immunosuppressive therapy is typically around 2-3 years. This duration may vary depending on the individual's specific condition and response to treatment, so it is important for patients to discuss their treatment plan with their healthcare provider."

        "pregunta": "7. In individuals with active or new onset lupus nephritis Class V, what is the recommended treatment for proteinuria levels above 1 g/g?",
        "respuesta": "In individuals with active or new onset lupus nephritis Class V, the recommended treatment for proteinuria levels above 1 g/g is typically a combination of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive medications such as mycophenolate mofetil or cyclophosphamide. These medications help to control inflammation and suppress the immune response that is causing damage to the kidneys. Additionally, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may be prescribed to help reduce proteinuria and protect the kidneys from further damage."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "8. How should non-responsive or refractory lupus nephritis be managed according to the ACR guideline?",
        "respuesta": "Non-responsive or refractory lupus nephritis should be managed according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline by considering alternative immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil, along with close monitoring of kidney function and disease activity. In severe cases, consideration may be given to other treatments such as rituximab or calcineurin inhibitors. It is important to work closely with a healthcare provider who specializes in treating lupus nephritis to develop an individualized treatment plan."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "9. What is the suggested escalation of treatment for individuals with inadequate renal response to initial DUAL therapy?",
        "respuesta": "For individuals with inadequate renal response to initial DUAL therapy, the suggested escalation of treatment may involve adding a third agent such as a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist or a SGLT2 inhibitor. This combination therapy can help improve renal function and better manage blood pressure and blood sugar levels in these individuals. Regular monitoring and adjustments to medication dosages may also be necessary to achieve optimal outcomes."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "10. When should referral for investigational therapy be considered in individuals with refractory lupus nephritis?",
        "respuesta": "Referral for investigational therapy should be considered in individuals with refractory lupus nephritis when standard treatments have failed to adequately control the disease and prevent further kidney damage. This may include cases where there is persistent proteinuria, declining kidney function, or ongoing active inflammation despite treatment with conventional therapies. Investigational therapies may offer new options for managing the disease and improving outcomes in these difficult-to-treat cases."
