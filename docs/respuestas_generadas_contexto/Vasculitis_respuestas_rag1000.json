These diseases affect smalland medium-sized vessels and are characterized by multisystem organ involvement. GPA is characterized histologically by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation in addition to vasculitis. Common clinical manifestations include destructive sinonasal lesions, pulmonary nodules, and pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. GPA is most commonly associated with cytoplasmic ANCA and antibodies to proteinase 3 (PR3). Among European populations, prevalence ranges from 24 to 157 cases per million, with the highest prevalence reported in",

The physicians on this panel included rheumatologists who could provide insight on all of these diseases and did not include other subspecialists who would not have experience with many of the other vasculitides addressed in this effort (e.g., pulmonologists who would not have experience with large-or medium-sized vessel vasculitis).

Common clinical manifestations include rapidly progressive pauci-immune glomerulonephritis and alveolar hemorrhage. MPA is most commonly associated with perinuclear ANCA and antibodies to myeloperoxidase. The prevalence of MPA ranges from 0 to 66 cases per million among European countries and 86 cases per million in Japan EGPA is characterized histologically by eosinophilic tissue infiltration in addition to vasculitis. Common clinical manifestations include asthma, peripheral eosinophilia, and peripheral neuropathy. Only 40% of patients produce detectable ANCA.

DISCUSSION In this guideline, we present the first ACR/Vasculitis Foundation recommendations for the management of GPA, MPA, and EGPA. Although these recommendations provide a general guide for disease management, the patient's clinical condition, preferences, and values should influence their treatment. Overall, these recommendations reflect the evolving management of these diseases, including the new roles for biologic therapies and aggressive strategies to minimize glucocorticoid toxicity. The recommendations for GPA and MPA are supported by a greater number of randomized trials than are currently available in EGPA. All of the recommendations made for these 3 diseases are conditional,"

The same considerations regarding prophylaxis to prevent this condition in patients with GPA/MPA apply to those with EGPA. DISCUSSION In this guideline, we present the first ACR/Vasculitis Foundation recommendations for the management of GPA, MPA, and EGPA. Although these recommendations provide a general guide for disease management, the patient's clinical condition, preferences, and values should influence their treatment. Overall, these recommendations reflect the evolving management of these diseases, including the new roles for biologic therapies and aggressive strategies to minimize glucocorticoid toxicity. The recommendations for GPA and MPA are supported by a greater number of randomized trials than are currently available in EGPA. All of the recommendations made for these 3 diseases are conditional,"
