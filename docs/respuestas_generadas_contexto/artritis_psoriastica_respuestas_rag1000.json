The guideline emphasizes the limited comparative efficacy/effectiveness evidence available to guide treatment decisions, particularly in terms of primary comparative benefit/efficacy and harms evidence. It also mentions ongoing trials, such as one comparing a TNFi biologic combination therapy with a TNFi biologic monotherapy and MTX monotherapy, which are expected to provide more information for future updates to the guideline.

Factors to consider when determining treatment options include the different clinical features of PsA, comorbidities, disease domains, and the patient's functional status.\n\nIn summary, PsA severity is defined based on various indicators mentioned in the guideline, and it plays a crucial role in guiding treatment decisions tailored to the individual patient's needs.",

The goal of this guideline is to assist health care providers in managing active PsA in their patients, including optimizing therapy.

This is not a formal definition. There have been many definitions of severe psoriasis used over time-the items here are adapted from the 2007 National Psoriasis Foundation expert consensus statement for moderate-to-severe psoriasis RESULTS/RECOMMENDATIONS How to interpret the recommendations 1. A strong recommendation means that the panel was confident that the desirable effects of following the recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects (or vice versa), so the course of action would apply to all or almost all patients, and only a small proportion of clinicians/patients not wanting to follow the recommendation.

For the purposes of these recommendations, severity is considered a broader concept than disease activity in that it encompasses the level of disease activity at a given time point, as well as the presence of poor prognostic factors and long-term damage. Examples of severe PsA disease include the presence of ≥1 of the following: a poor prognostic factor (erosive disease, elevated levels of inflammation markers such as C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate attributable to PsA), long-term damage that interferes with function (e.g., joint deformities, vision loss), highly active disease that causes major impairment in quality of life (i.e., active psoriatic inflammatory disease at many sites [including"
