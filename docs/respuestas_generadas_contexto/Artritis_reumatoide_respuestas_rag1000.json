The recommendation statements in this update are not directly comparable to the ACR 2015 guidelines  because they do not retain the early versus established RA subgroups. Nevertheless, there are some notable differences. First, the 2015 guidelines recommend csDMARD monotherapy, preferably with methotrexate, for patients with both low and moderate/high disease activity, whereas this update recommends an initial trial of hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine for those with low disease activity. Second, the 2015 guidelines recommended DMARD tapering for patients who are in remission.

DISCUSSION The ACR guidelines were developed to provide clinicians with recommendations for decisions frequently faced in clinical practice. Several new topics are included in this update, including recommendations for administration of methotrexate, use of methotrexate in patients with subcutaneous nodules, pulmonary disease, and NAFLD, use of rituximab in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, and treatment of RA in patients with NTM lung disease.

Initiation of a csDMARD without longerterm (≥3 months) glucocorticoids is strongly recommended over initiation of a csDMARD with longer-term glucocorticoids for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity Although some patients may require longer-term glucocorticoids, this strong recommendation against longer-term glucocorticoid therapy is made because of its significant toxicity. Recommendations for DMARD-naive patients with low disease activity (Table 2) Hydroxychloroquine is conditionally recommended over other csDMARDs, sulfasalazine is conditionally recommended over methotrexate, and methotrexate is conditionally recommended over leflunomide for DMARDnaive patients with low disease activity Hydroxychloroquine is conditionally recommended over other csDMARDs because it is better tolerated and has a more favorable risk profile in patients with RA.

Although an increased risk of infection has been described in RA patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, it is not known if a switch in DMARDs in patients who are at target is more effective in lowering infection risk while maintaining disease control than continuation of rituximab. The recommendation is conditional because physician and patient risk tolerance is likely to vary depending on the degree of hypogammaglobulinemia and patient-specific risk factors for infection.
