        "pregunta": "1. What are the key extraarticular conditions that may influence the management of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), according to the clinical guidelines?",
        "respuesta": "Some key extraarticular conditions that may influence the management of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) according to clinical guidelines include uveitis (inflammation of the eye), growth disturbances, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and psychological issues such as anxiety and depression. These conditions may require additional monitoring and treatment in conjunction with the management of JIA to ensure the overall well-being of the patient."

    {
        "pregunta": "2. Why is longer-term glucocorticoid therapy not appropriate in childhood for JIA patients?",
        "respuesta": "Longer-term glucocorticoid therapy is not appropriate in childhood for JIA patients because it can lead to numerous side effects, including growth retardation, osteoporosis, weight gain, hypertension, and increased susceptibility to infections. These side effects can have serious long-term consequences on a child's health and development. Therefore, other treatment options such as disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are typically preferred for managing JIA in children."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "3. What is the recommended approach for shared decision-making when considering treatment options for JIA?",
        "respuesta": "The recommended approach for shared decision-making when considering treatment options for Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) involves involving both the healthcare provider and the patient (or their caregiver) in the decision-making process. This includes discussing the available treatment options, potential benefits and risks of each option, and considering the patient's preferences and goals. It is important to have open communication, ask questions, and work collaboratively to come to a decision that is best suited for the individual patient's needs and preferences."

    {
        "pregunta": "4. What is the role of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the initial therapy for active oligoarthritis in JIA?",
        "respuesta": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly used as part of the initial therapy for active oligoarthritis in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). They help reduce inflammation and relieve pain and swelling in the affected joints. NSAIDs are often used in combination with other medications such as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to help manage symptoms and improve overall outcomes in patients with JIA."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "5. Why are intraarticular glucocorticoids strongly recommended as part of initial therapy for active oligoarthritis in JIA?",
        "respuesta": "Intraarticular glucocorticoids are strongly recommended as part of initial therapy for active oligoarthritis in JIA because they can provide rapid and targeted relief of inflammation and pain within the affected joints. This can help improve symptoms and function, reduce the need for systemic medications with potential side effects, and potentially prevent joint damage in the long term."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "6. Which conventional synthetic DMARD is conditionally recommended as a preferred agent for JIA patients with inadequate response to NSAIDs and/or intraarticular glucocorticoids?",
        "respuesta": "Methotrexate is conditionally recommended as a preferred agent for JIA patients with inadequate response to NSAIDs and/or intraarticular glucocorticoids."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "7. What is the rationale behind the preference for subcutaneous over oral administration of methotrexate in JIA patients with polyarticular arthritis?",
        "respuesta": "The rationale behind the preference for subcutaneous over oral administration of methotrexate in JIA patients with polyarticular arthritis is that subcutaneous administration has been shown to have higher bioavailability and better absorption compared to oral administration. This route of administration also allows for more consistent blood levels of the medication, which can lead to better efficacy and fewer side effects. Additionally, subcutaneous administration may be more convenient for some patients as it can be administered at home rather than needing to go to a healthcare facility for intravenous administration."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "8. When should biologic DMARDs be strongly recommended for JIA patients with inadequate response to NSAIDs and/or conventional synthetic DMARDs?",
        "respuesta": "Biologic DMARDs should be strongly recommended for JIA patients with inadequate response to NSAIDs and/or conventional synthetic DMARDs when there is evidence of ongoing disease activity, joint damage, functional impairment, or when the disease is significantly impacting the patient's quality of life. These medications are typically considered when other treatment options have not been effective in controlling the disease."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "9. Why is formal assessment of disease activity using validated measures conditionally recommended for JIA patients?",
        "respuesta": "Formal assessment of disease activity using validated measures is conditionally recommended for JIA patients because it allows healthcare providers to objectively evaluate the severity of the disease, track changes over time, and make informed treatment decisions. This practice ensures that patients receive appropriate care and management tailored to their individual needs, ultimately improving their outcomes and quality of life."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "10. What is the recommended initial therapy for systemic JIA without macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) according to the guidelines?",
        "respuesta": "The recommended initial therapy for systemic JIA without macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) according to the guidelines is typically a combination of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and corticosteroids. This approach helps to reduce inflammation and manage symptoms in patients with systemic JIA. Additional medications such as disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may also be considered depending on the severity of the condition."
