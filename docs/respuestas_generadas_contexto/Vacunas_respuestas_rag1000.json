        "respuesta": "The recommended pneumococcal vaccination strategy for patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) under the age of 65 who are taking immunosuppressive medication is to strongly recommend administering pneumococcal vaccination to these individuals. This recommendation is based on the guidelines that highlight the importance of pneumococcal vaccination for RMD patients taking immunosuppressive medication, as they may be at an increased risk of pneumococcal infection. It is crucial to follow this vaccination strategy to help protect these patients from potential health risks associated with pneumococcal infections.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need more information, feel free to ask.",
