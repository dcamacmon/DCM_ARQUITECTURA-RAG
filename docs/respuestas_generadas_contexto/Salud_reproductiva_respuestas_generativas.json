        "pregunta": "1. What are the recommendations for patients with RMD regarding the use of combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives?",
        "respuesta": "For patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD), the use of combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives is generally considered safe and effective. However, it is important for patients to consult with their healthcare provider before starting any new form of contraception, as individual factors such as disease activity, medication use, and overall health status may influence the choice of contraceptive method. In some cases, alternative forms of contraception may be recommended to minimize potential risks and interactions with RMD treatments."

        "pregunta": "2. What is the preferred approach for patients at risk for osteoporosis in terms of contraceptive options?",
        "respuesta": "For patients at risk for osteoporosis, the preferred approach for contraceptive options would be to avoid estrogen-containing contraceptives such as combined oral contraceptives or hormonal intrauterine devices. These methods have been associated with a slight increase in the risk of osteoporosis. Instead, patients may consider non-hormonal options such as barrier methods, copper intrauterine devices, or progestin-only contraceptives like the mini-pill or the progestin-only implant. It is important for patients to discuss their individual risk factors and preferences with their healthcare provider to determine the most appropriate contraceptive option for them."

        "respuesta": "It is generally recommended that women on RMD medications such as HCQ, colchicine, and TNF inhibitors continue breastfeeding while under the supervision of a healthcare provider. While these medications may pass into breastmilk, the benefits of breastfeeding often outweigh the potential risks. Close monitoring of both the mother and baby is important to ensure that any potential side effects are identified and managed promptly.

        "respuesta": "Breastfeeding while taking prednisone at different dose levels should be managed by consulting with a healthcare provider. Lower doses of prednisone are generally considered safe for breastfeeding mothers, as only small amounts of the medication pass into breast milk. However, higher doses may require closer monitoring or alternative treatment options to minimize any potential risks to the infant. It is important to weigh the benefits of breastfeeding against the risks of taking prednisone and make an informed decision with guidance from a healthcare professional."
