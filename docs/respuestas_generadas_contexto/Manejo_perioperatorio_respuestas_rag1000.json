The guideline specifies that conditional recommendations are made when there is uncertainty regarding the balance of benefits and harms, when the evidence certainty is low or very low, when the decision is sensitive to individual patient preferences, or when costs are expected to impact the decision. Therefore, incorporating patient preferences is considered essential in decision-making, leading to the classification of all recommendations as conditional.",

A conditional recommendation means that the panel believed the desirable effects of following the recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, so the course of action would apply to the majority of the patients, but a small proportion of clinicians/patients may not want to follow the recommendation. Because of this, conditional recommendations are preference sensitive and always warrant a shared decision-making approach. We use the phrase \"is recommended over\" or \"is/would be recommended\" for conditional recommendations. We specify conditions under which the less preferred drug may be used by using the phrase \"may be used\" or \"may consider\" or \"Y (less preferred drug) may be used instead of X (preferred drug)\" or \"may consider Y instead of X (preferred drug)\" for conditional recommendations.",

For a conditional recommendation, the recommended course of action would apply to the majority of the patients, but the alternative is a reasonable consideration. Conditional recommendations always warrant a shared decisionmaking approach. We specify some conditions under which the alternative may be considered. In some instances, the committee found that the evidence for a particular PICO question did not support a graded recommendation or did not favor one intervention over the other.

The Voting Panel agreed with their inclusion via email voting. This guideline is informed by cohort studies including pharmacoepidemiologic studies using large administrative databases. To our knowledge, there have been no randomized controlled trials since the publication of the prior ACR/AAHKS guideline in 2017, so much of the data supporting these recommendations remains largely indirect or of low quality. Similar to the last guideline, the major limitation remains the paucity of high-quality direct evidence regarding the added risk of infection from medication use at the time of THA or TKA; therefore, these recommendations continue to rely on indirect studies describing results in patients without rheumatic diseases or on assumptions or conclusions extrapolated from nonsurgical studies. An additional limitation of this guideline is the lack of"
