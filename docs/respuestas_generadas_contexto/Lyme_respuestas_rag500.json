If patients have skin lesions suggestive of, but atypical for erythema migrans, antibody testing on an acute-phase serum sample is suggested followed by a convalescent-phase serum sample if necessary. For patients with plausible exposure to ticks infected with B. burgdorferi, testing for Lyme disease is recommended to determine if transmission has occurred.
