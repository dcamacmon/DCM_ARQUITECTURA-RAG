The recommendations aim to assist healthcare providers in making informed decisions in the treatment of PMR, including the use of glucocorticoids, disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), and the duration of treatment. Additionally, the recommendations are intended to address the challenges of glucocorticoid dosages, tapering strategies, and the prevention of relapses and long-term glucocorticoid dependency in patients with PMR.",
