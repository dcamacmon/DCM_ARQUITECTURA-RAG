        "pregunta": "1. What are the key guiding principles for determining the optimal timing of elective hip or knee arthroplasty for patients with symptomatic moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis or advanced symptomatic osteonecrosis with secondary arthritis?",
        "respuesta": "The key guiding principles for determining the optimal timing of elective hip or knee arthroplasty for patients with symptomatic moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis or advanced symptomatic osteonecrosis with secondary arthritis include assessing the severity of symptoms, level of functional impairment, impact on quality of life, failure of conservative treatments, presence of joint deformity, and progression of joint damage. Additionally, considering the patient's age, overall health status, and expectations for surgery outcomes are also important factors in determining the optimal timing for arthroplasty. Ultimately, the decision should be made collaboratively between the patient and their healthcare provider based on individual circumstances and goals."

        "pregunta": "2. What nonoperative therapies should be tried and found ineffective before considering elective total joint arthroplasty (TJA) for patients with radiographically moderate-to-severe OA or advanced ON with secondary arthritis?",
        "respuesta": "Before considering elective total joint arthroplasty (TJA) for patients with radiographically moderate-to-severe OA or advanced ON with secondary arthritis, nonoperative therapies that should be tried and found ineffective include physical therapy, weight loss, activity modification, assistive devices (e.g. cane or brace), medications (such as NSAIDs or corticosteroid injections), and joint injections (e.g. hyaluronic acid). These conservative treatments aim to manage symptoms and improve function before resorting to surgical intervention."

        "pregunta": "3. How should patient preferences be incorporated into the decision-making process for elective TJA in patients with symptomatic OA or ON?",
        "respuesta": "Patient preferences should be incorporated into the decision-making process for elective total joint arthroplasty (TJA) in patients with symptomatic osteoarthritis (OA) or osteonecrosis (ON) by involving them in shared decision-making discussions with their healthcare provider. This includes discussing the risks, benefits, and alternatives of surgery, as well as understanding the patient's goals, expectations, and concerns. Patient preferences can be incorporated by considering factors such as pain relief, functional improvement, recovery time, potential complications, and long-term outcomes when deciding on the most appropriate treatment plan. Ultimately, the decision should be made collaboratively with the patient to ensure that their individual needs and preferences are taken into account."

        "pregunta": "4. What are the recommendations regarding modifying risk factors such as BMI, glycemic control, and nicotine dependence before proceeding with TJA?",
        "respuesta": "It is recommended to address and modify risk factors such as high BMI, poor glycemic control, and nicotine dependence before proceeding with Total Joint Arthroplasty (TJA). This is because these factors can increase the risk of complications during and after surgery. Patients with a high BMI are at increased risk of surgical site infections, delayed wound healing, and implant failure. Poor glycemic control can lead to complications such as infection, poor wound healing, and increased risk of deep vein thrombosis. Nicotine dependence can also negatively impact surgical outcomes by impairing wound healing and increasing the risk of infection. Therefore, optimizing these risk factors before TJA can help improve surgical outcomes and reduce the likelihood of postoperative complications."

        "pregunta": "5. What is the rationale behind the conditional recommendation to proceed to TJA without delay over delaying arthroplasty for a trial of physical therapy in the defined population?",
        "respuesta": "The rationale behind the conditional recommendation to proceed to total joint arthroplasty (TJA) without delay over delaying arthroplasty for a trial of physical therapy in the defined population is that TJA has been shown to be an effective treatment for severe osteoarthritis and can significantly improve quality of life and function in patients. Delaying arthroplasty for a trial of physical therapy may result in prolonged pain, decreased mobility, and reduced quality of life for the patient. Additionally, evidence suggests that delaying TJA may lead to worse outcomes and increased risk of complications. Therefore, in this specific population with severe osteoarthritis, proceeding to TJA without delay is recommended to provide the best chance for optimal outcomes and improved quality of life."

        "pregunta": "6. Why is mandated physical therapy not recommended to delay or avoid surgery for patients indicated for TJA in the clinical guideline?",
        "respuesta": "Mandated physical therapy is not recommended to delay or avoid surgery for patients indicated for total joint arthroplasty (TJA) in clinical guidelines because physical therapy alone may not effectively address the underlying joint damage or degeneration that necessitates surgery. TJA is typically recommended when conservative treatments, such as physical therapy, have failed to provide adequate relief from symptoms and improve joint function. Therefore, delaying surgery in favor of physical therapy may prolong the patient's suffering and delay the necessary treatment for their condition."

        "pregunta": "7. In patients with a BMI of ≥50, what is the conditional recommendation regarding proceeding to TJA without delaying to achieve weight reduction to a BMI of <50?",
        "respuesta": "In patients with a BMI of ≥50, the conditional recommendation regarding proceeding to total joint arthroplasty (TJA) without delaying to achieve weight reduction to a BMI of <50 is that the benefits of surgery may outweigh the risks associated with a higher BMI. However, it is important for the patient to be aware that having a higher BMI can increase the risk of complications during and after surgery, and efforts should still be made to optimize weight and overall health before proceeding with TJA."

    {
        "pregunta": "8. For patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, what is the conditional recommendation regarding delaying TJA to improve glycemic control?",
        "respuesta": "The conditional recommendation for patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus is to delay total joint arthroplasty (TJA) in order to improve glycemic control. This is because uncontrolled diabetes can increase the risk of complications during and after surgery, such as infection and delayed wound healing. It is important for patients to work with their healthcare team to optimize their diabetes management before undergoing TJA to reduce these risks."

    {
        "pregunta": "9. Why is proceeding to TJA without delay recommended over delaying TJA for patients with bone loss with deformity or severe ligamentous instability in the defined population?",
        "respuesta": "Proceeding to total joint arthroplasty (TJA) without delay is recommended over delaying TJA for patients with bone loss, deformity, or severe ligamentous instability because delaying surgery in these cases can lead to further deterioration of the joint, increased pain, reduced function, and potentially worsened outcomes post-surgery. Additionally, delaying TJA can increase the complexity of the surgery, the risk of complications, and the need for additional procedures. Early intervention in these high-risk cases can help improve patient outcomes and quality of life."

        "pregunta": "10. What are the considerations for patients with a neuropathic joint in the conditional recommendation to proceed to TJA without delay over delaying for optimization of non-life-threatening conditions?",
        "respuesta": "Patients with a neuropathic joint may have impaired sensation and proprioception, leading to increased risk of joint damage and deformity. Therefore, the consideration for proceeding to total joint arthroplasty without delay over delaying for optimization of non-life-threatening conditions is to prevent further joint destruction and improve overall function and quality of life for the patient. Delaying surgery may result in worsening joint damage and increased difficulty in achieving successful outcomes post-surgery."
