        "pregunta": "1. What is the recommended treatment approach for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis, according to the 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline?",
        "respuesta": "The recommended treatment approach for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis, according to the 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline, is to start with conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs) such as methotrexate as first-line therapy. If the patient does not respond adequately to csDMARDs, then biologic DMARDs or targeted synthetic DMARDs may be considered as second-line therapy."

        "pregunta": "2. In patients with subcutaneous nodules and moderate-to-high disease activity, what is the preferred DMARD therapy based on the guideline?",
        "respuesta": "The preferred DMARD therapy for patients with subcutaneous nodules and moderate-to-high disease activity is methotrexate, according to guidelines."

    {
        "pregunta": "3. For patients with pulmonary disease and moderate-to-high disease activity, what is the recommended DMARD treatment according to the guideline?",
        "respuesta": "For patients with pulmonary disease and moderate-to-high disease activity, the recommended DMARD treatment according to guidelines is typically methotrexate, as it has been shown to be effective in reducing inflammation and slowing disease progression in these patients. In some cases, combination therapy with other DMARDs or biologic agents may be considered depending on the individual's specific condition and response to treatment."

    {
        "pregunta": "4. What is the suggested course of action for patients with heart failure and inadequate response to csDMARDs, as per the guideline?",
        "respuesta": "For patients with heart failure and inadequate response to conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), the guideline suggests considering switching to biologic or targeted synthetic DMARDs, such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitors or Janus kinase inhibitors, in order to better manage their condition and improve outcomes. It is important for healthcare providers to closely monitor these patients and adjust treatment as needed to optimize their care."

    {
        "pregunta": "5. In patients with lymphoproliferative disorder and moderate-to-high disease activity, what is the preferred DMARD therapy based on the guideline?",
        "respuesta": "In patients with lymphoproliferative disorder and moderate-to-high disease activity, the preferred DMARD therapy based on guidelines is typically methotrexate. Methotrexate is a commonly used DMARD in these patients due to its effectiveness in controlling disease activity and its relatively safe profile compared to other DMARDs."

        "pregunta": "6. How should healthcare providers manage patients with hepatitis B infection initiating rituximab therapy, as per the guideline?",
        "respuesta": "Healthcare providers should screen patients for hepatitis B infection prior to initiating rituximab therapy. Patients with chronic hepatitis B infection should receive antiviral prophylaxis before starting rituximab to prevent reactivation of the virus. Close monitoring of liver function tests and viral load is recommended during and after rituximab therapy in hepatitis B-positive patients. In cases of hepatitis B reactivation, prompt intervention with antiviral therapy is crucial to prevent serious liver complications."

    {
        "pregunta": "7. What is the recommended approach for DMARD-naive patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and moderate-to-high disease activity, according to the guideline?",
        "respuesta": "The recommended approach for DMARD-naive patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and moderate-to-high disease activity, according to the guideline, is to initiate treatment with methotrexate. Methotrexate is considered safe and effective for treating rheumatoid arthritis in patients with liver disease, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Close monitoring of liver function tests is recommended during treatment with methotrexate to ensure safety."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "8. In patients with persistent hypogammaglobulinemia without infection, what is the guideline's recommendation regarding rituximab therapy continuation?",
        "respuesta": "The guideline recommends considering discontinuing rituximab therapy in patients with persistent hypogammaglobulinemia without infection. This is because rituximab can further reduce immunoglobulin levels and increase the risk of infections in these patients. Close monitoring and alternative treatment options should be considered in such cases."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "9. For patients with a history of serious infection within the previous 12 months and moderate-to-high disease activity, what is the recommended treatment approach according to the guideline?",
        "respuesta": "For patients with a history of serious infection within the previous 12 months and moderate-to-high disease activity, the recommended treatment approach according to the guideline is typically to consider the use of biologic agents with caution, in consultation with an infectious disease specialist. These medications may increase the risk of infection, so careful monitoring and management are required to balance the benefits of treatment with the potential risks."

    {
        "pregunta": "10. How should healthcare providers manage patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease and moderate-to-high disease activity despite csDMARD monotherapy, based on the guideline's recommendations?",
        "respuesta": "Patients with nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease and moderate-to-high disease activity despite csDMARD monotherapy should be managed by considering adding or switching to a different type of disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) or combination therapy. It is important for healthcare providers to closely monitor the patient's response to treatment and adjust as needed to achieve optimal disease control and outcomes."
