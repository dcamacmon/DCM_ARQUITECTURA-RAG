        "respuesta": "The rationale behind recommending screening with pulmonary function tests (PFTs) over history and physical examination alone for patients at increased risk of developing interstitial lung disease (ILD) is based on the following considerations:\n\n1. Objective assessment: PFTs provide objective measurements of lung function, including spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity, which can help in detecting early signs of ILD even in the absence of obvious symptoms. This objective data can assist in identifying abnormalities in lung function that may not be evident through history and physical examination alone.\n\n2. Sensitivity and specificity: PFTs have been shown to have higher sensitivity and specificity in detecting ILD compared to relying solely on history and physical examination findings. This helps in accurate identification of individuals at risk of ILD and facilitates prompt intervention and management, leading to better outcomes.\n\n3. Monitoring disease progression: Regular monitoring with PFTs allows for longitudinal assessment of lung function over time, enabling healthcare providers to track changes in pulmonary function and detect progression of ILD. This information is essential for guiding treatment decisions and optimizing care for patients at risk of ILD.\n\n4. Early detection and intervention: Screening with PFTs can help in the early detection of ILD, allowing for timely intervention and management strategies to be implemented. Early diagnosis and treatment of ILD have been associated with improved outcomes and may help in preventing further complications or disease progression.\n\nOverall, the recommendation for screening with PFTs over history and physical examination alone for patients at increased risk of developing ILD is based on the need for objective, sensitive, and specific assessments of lung function to enable early detection, accurate diagnosis, and effective management of ILD in this patient population.",

For people with SARD-ILD, we suggest monitoring for ambulatory desaturation every 3 to 12 months. There was a discrepancy between the application of this clinical assessment by rheumatologists and pulmonologists. Testing for ambulatory desaturation is inexpensive and informs a patient's need for supplemental oxygen. However, evaluation of ambulatory desaturation is not routine practice for many rheumatologists, and there may be operational challenges in performing ambulatory desaturation testing in some rheumatology offices.

Because the guidance on frequency was based on expert opinion and patient preferences rather than evidence, we aimed for uniformity in our recommendations across diseases to ease implementation. We recognize that the frequency of monitoring will vary based on individual disease presentation and shared decision-making with each patient. It was challenging for this group to reach consensus on the recommendation for ambulatory oxygen desaturation testing and the frequency of this testing. In people with Raynaud phenomenon, oxygen desaturation testing using a finger probe may not be accurate and, thus, may lead to the inappropriate prescription of supplemental oxygen. In such cases, ear or forehead probes offer potential for greater accuracy."

This guideline was developed to provide recommendations for the screening of ILD in people with SARDs (RA, SSc, IIM, MCTD, and SjD) at greatest risk of ILD and for monitoring for ILD progression. These recommendations will facilitate rheumatologists' identification of people with SARDs who have ILD and assist in optimizing the co-management of people with SARDassociated ILD by rheumatologists and pulmonologists.

        "pregunta": "10. Why is monitoring with both PFTs and HRCT chest recommended over PFTs alone for patients with SARD-ILD?",
        "respuesta": "The rationale behind recommending monitoring with both pulmonary function tests (PFTs) and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest over PFTs alone for patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease-associated interstitial lung disease (SARD-ILD) is based on the following considerations:\n\n1. Comprehensive assessment: The combined use of PFTs and HRCT chest allows for a more comprehensive assessment of lung function and structure in individuals with SARD-ILD. PFTs provide objective data on lung function, including spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity, which can help in monitoring changes over time. HRCT chest provides detailed imaging of the lungs, offering valuable information on the presence and extent of interstitial abnormalities.\n\n2. Improved diagnostic accuracy: Monitoring with both PFTs and HRCT chest increases the diagnostic accuracy for detecting and monitoring ILD in patients with SARD, compared to relying solely on PFTs. HRCT chest can detect subtle changes in the lungs that may not be captured by PFTs alone, leading to earlier detection of ILD progression.\n\n3. Early detection of ILD progression: The combination of PFTs and HRCT chest allows for earlier detection of ILD progression, facilitating timely intervention and management strategies. This approach enables healthcare providers to monitor changes in lung function and structure, identify disease progression, and adjust treatment plans accordingly.\n\n4. Tailored management: Monitoring with both PFTs and HRCT chest helps in tailoring treatment strategies and optimizing care for individuals with SARD-ILD. By combining functional and imaging assessments, healthcare providers can gain a more holistic view of the patient's lung health, enabling personalized management approaches.\n\nOverall, the recommendation for monitoring with both PFTs and HRCT chest over PFTs alone for patients with SARD-ILD is aimed at providing a comprehensive and accurate evaluation of lung function and structure, facilitating early detection of ILD progression, and guiding tailored management strategies for better patient outcomes.",
