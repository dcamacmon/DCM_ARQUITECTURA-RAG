        "pregunta": "1. What is the recommended pneumococcal vaccination strategy for patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) under the age of 65 who are taking immunosuppressive medication?",
        "respuesta": "For patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) under the age of 65 who are taking immunosuppressive medication, the recommended pneumococcal vaccination strategy is to receive both the 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) followed by the 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) at least 8 weeks apart. This sequential vaccination strategy helps provide optimal protection against pneumococcal infections in this high-risk population."

        "pregunta": "2. Should patients with RMD receive vaccination against varicella-zoster virus (VZV) at age under 50 years if they are taking immunosuppressive medication?",
        "respuesta": "Yes, patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) who are taking immunosuppressive medication should receive vaccination against varicella-zoster virus (VZV) at age under 50 years. This is because VZV can cause severe complications in individuals with weakened immune systems, and vaccination can help protect against the virus. It is important for patients to consult with their healthcare provider to determine the best course of action based on their individual situation."

        "pregunta": "3. What is the recommended approach for patients with RMD who are taking rituximab in terms of timing non-live attenuated vaccine administration relative to the next dose of medication?",
        "respuesta": "The recommended approach for patients with Rheumatic Musculoskeletal Diseases (RMD) who are taking rituximab is to administer non-live attenuated vaccines at least 4 weeks before starting rituximab or at least 6 months after the last dose of rituximab. This timing helps ensure optimal immune response to the vaccine without interference from the medication."

    {
        "pregunta": "4. How does the immunogenicity or efficacy of influenza vaccine differ in patients with RMD taking high-dose steroids compared to those taking lower doses or not taking steroids?",
        "respuesta": "The immunogenicity or efficacy of influenza vaccine may be reduced in patients with rheumatic musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) taking high-dose steroids compared to those taking lower doses or not taking steroids. This is because high-dose steroids can suppress the immune system and potentially decrease the body's ability to generate a strong immune response to the vaccine. It is important for individuals with RMD taking high-dose steroids to discuss their vaccination schedule with their healthcare provider to ensure they are receiving optimal protection against influenza."

    {
        "pregunta": "5. Should patients with RMD taking the equivalent of prednisone ≤10 mg daily receive any non-live attenuated vaccinations?",
        "respuesta": "Yes, patients with rheumatic musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) taking the equivalent of prednisone ≤10 mg daily should receive non-live attenuated vaccinations. These vaccinations are generally safe for individuals with compromised immune systems and can help protect against various diseases. It is important for individuals with RMD to discuss their vaccination schedule with their healthcare provider to ensure they are receiving the appropriate immunizations."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "6. What is the recommended vaccination approach for patients with RMD taking the equivalent of prednisone >10 mg daily but <20 mg daily in terms of non-live attenuated vaccinations?",
        "respuesta": "For patients with Rheumatic Musculoskeletal Diseases (RMD) taking the equivalent of prednisone >10 mg daily but <20 mg daily, the recommended vaccination approach for non-live attenuated vaccinations is to administer them as scheduled and according to age-appropriate guidelines. It is important for patients with RMD to stay up to date on their vaccinations to help protect against preventable diseases, especially since they may be at a higher risk of infections due to their condition and medication."

    {
        "pregunta": "7. Should patients with RMD taking the equivalent of prednisone ≥20 mg daily receive influenza vaccination?",
        "respuesta": "Yes, patients with rheumatic musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) who are taking the equivalent of prednisone ≥20 mg daily should receive influenza vaccination. Influenza vaccination can help protect these patients from potentially severe complications of the flu due to their weakened immune system from the high dose of prednisone. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before getting vaccinated to ensure it is safe and appropriate for the individual patient."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "8. What is the effect of drug Y or drug class on immunization responses to vaccine Z in patients with RMD compared to the general population or another drug?",
        "respuesta": "The effect of drug Y or drug class on immunization responses to vaccine Z in patients with RMD (rheumatic musculoskeletal disease) compared to the general population or another drug can vary. Some drugs used to treat RMD, such as corticosteroids or biologic agents, may suppress the immune system and potentially decrease the effectiveness of vaccines. It is important for patients with RMD to discuss their vaccination schedule with their healthcare provider to ensure they are receiving appropriate protection."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "9. Should patients with RMD hold methotrexate for 2 weeks after influenza vaccination if disease activity allows?",
        "respuesta": "It is generally recommended for patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) who are on methotrexate to hold the medication for 1-2 weeks after receiving an influenza vaccination. This is to allow for a better immune response to the vaccine. However, the decision should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the individual's disease activity and overall health status. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider before making any changes to medication regimens."

    {
        "pregunta": "10. Is there a difference in the seroconversion rates between younger patients with rheumatoid arthritis receiving high-dose influenza vaccination compared to standard-dose vaccination?",
        "respuesta": "I don't know."
