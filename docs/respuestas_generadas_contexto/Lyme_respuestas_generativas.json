        "pregunta": "1. What measures should be used to prevent tick bites and tick-borne infections according to the clinical practice guidelines?",
        "respuesta": "According to clinical practice guidelines, measures to prevent tick bites and tick-borne infections include:\n\n1. Avoiding wooded and brushy areas with high grass and leaf litter.\n2. Using insect repellent containing DEET on exposed skin and clothing.\n3. Wearing long sleeves and pants, tucking pants into socks or boots, and wearing light-colored clothing to easily spot ticks.\n4. Performing regular tick checks on yourself, your children, and pets after being outdoors.\n5. Promptly removing any attached ticks with fine-tipped tweezers, grasping the tick as close to the skin's surface as possible and pulling straight out with steady pressure.\n6. Washing hands and the bite area with soap and water after removing the tick.\n7. Consulting a healthcare provider if you develop a fever, rash, or other symptoms of a tick-borne illness after a tick bite.\n\nThese measures can help reduce the risk of tick bites and the transmission of tick-borne infections."

        "pregunta": "2. What is the recommended antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing Lyme disease following a high-risk tick bite?",
        "respuesta": "The recommended antibiotic prophylaxis for preventing Lyme disease following a high-risk tick bite is a single dose of doxycycline within 72 hours of the tick bite. This is especially recommended if the tick was attached for more than 36 hours, comes from a high-risk area for Lyme disease, and is identified as a black-legged tick (deer tick). It is important to consult with a healthcare provider for proper evaluation and treatment."

        "pregunta": "3. What diagnostic tests should be used following a tick bite according to the guidelines?",
        "respuesta": "According to guidelines, diagnostic tests following a tick bite may include a physical examination, blood tests to check for tick-borne diseases such as Lyme disease, and potentially a skin biopsy or culture of the tick itself to identify any pathogens it may be carrying. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider for proper evaluation and testing after a tick bite."

        "pregunta": "4. What is the preferred antibiotic regimen for the chemoprophylaxis of Lyme disease following a high-risk tick bite?",
        "respuesta": "The preferred antibiotic regimen for the chemoprophylaxis of Lyme disease following a high-risk tick bite is a single dose of doxycycline 200 mg. This regimen has been shown to be effective in preventing the development of Lyme disease after a tick bite in areas where the prevalence of the disease is high."

        "pregunta": "5. What is the preferred diagnostic testing strategy for erythema migrans according to the guidelines?",
        "respuesta": "The preferred diagnostic testing strategy for erythema migrans, as per the guidelines, is clinical diagnosis based on the characteristic appearance of the skin lesion. This is usually sufficient for diagnosing Lyme disease in patients with a history of tick exposure in an endemic area. Additional laboratory testing, such as serologic testing for antibodies against Borrelia burgdorferi, may be considered in cases where the diagnosis is unclear or if there are atypical presentations."

        "pregunta": "6. What are the preferred antibiotic regimens for the treatment of erythema migrans as recommended in the guidelines?",
        "respuesta": "The preferred antibiotic regimens for the treatment of erythema migrans, as recommended in guidelines, typically include doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil. These antibiotics are usually prescribed for a period of 10-21 days, depending on the severity of the infection and the patient's overall health. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment plan."

        "pregunta": "8. Should patients with the southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI) be treated with antibiotics according to the guidelines?",
        "respuesta": "Yes, patients with southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI) should be treated with antibiotics according to the guidelines. STARI is caused by the bite of the lone star tick and is similar to Lyme disease in terms of symptoms. Antibiotics such as doxycycline are commonly used to treat STARI and can help prevent further complications. It is important to follow the recommended treatment guidelines to ensure a successful recovery."

        "pregunta": "10. For which neurologic presentations should patients be tested for Lyme disease as recommended in the clinical practice guidelines?",
        "respuesta": "Patients should be tested for Lyme disease if they present with symptoms such as facial nerve palsy (Bell's palsy), radiculopathy, lymphocytic meningitis, encephalitis, or myelitis, as recommended in the clinical practice guidelines. Testing should also be considered for patients with other neurologic manifestations such as peripheral neuropathy or cognitive impairment."
