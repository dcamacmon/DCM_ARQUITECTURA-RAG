The efficacy of NSAIDs for symptom improvement in active AS has been established in many controlled trials. Evidence that continuous NSAID use results in slower rates of spinal fusion on radiographs over 2 years compared to on-demand NSAID use is inconsistent, with results of one trial of"

        "respuesta": "The recommended approach for assessing disease activity in adults with nonradiographic axial SpA is to conditionally recommend against using a treat-to-target strategy with a target of ASDAS <1.3 (or 2.1) over a treatment strategy based on physician assessment. Additionally, obtaining a pelvis MRI to assess activity in adults with nonradiographic axial SpA of unclear activity while on a biologic is also conditionally recommended. Limited evidence suggests that MRI findings may impact treatment recommendations, but the degree of inflammatory change on MRI may not necessarily correlate with treatment responses. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider for personalized guidance on assessing disease activity in nonradiographic axial SpA.",

The concept of treat-to-target strategies is well-founded in chronic disease management for conditions that have an accurate measure of disease activity (often one that is asymptomatic, as in blood pressure or glycosylated hemoglobin), a tight link between this disease activity measure and future health outcomes, and evidence that maintaining a particular target in the disease activity measure is closely associated with better long-term health In adults with AS of unclear activity while receiving a biologic, we conditionally recommend obtaining a spinal or pelvis MRI to assess activity (new, PICO 68).

In adults with stable nonradiographic axial SpA, we conditionally recommend against obtaining a spine or pelvis MRI to confirm inactivity (new, PICO 82). Because the clinical assessment of inflammation in axial SpA has many limitations, questions may arise about whether subclinical inflammation that could be detected by MRI is being \"missed\" by either the physical examination, symptoms, or laboratory studies. Given the lack of evidence that obtaining an MRI in stable patients improves clinical outcomes, the only moderate sensitivity and specificity of MRI-defined abnormalities for measurement of activity in axial SpA, the burden of testing, and concern for possible overtreatment, the panel recommended against obtaining an MRI in this setting.
