        "pregunta": "1. What are the key recommendations for perioperative management of antirheumatic medication in patients with rheumatic diseases undergoing elective total hip or total knee arthroplasty according to the 2022 American College of Rheumatology guideline?",
        "respuesta": "The key recommendations for perioperative management of antirheumatic medication in patients with rheumatic diseases undergoing elective total hip or total knee arthroplasty according to the 2022 American College of Rheumatology guideline include:\n\n1. Methotrexate should be continued perioperatively to reduce disease flares.\n2. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided perioperatively due to increased risk of bleeding and impaired bone healing.\n3. Biologic agents should be held perioperatively to reduce the risk of infection.\n4. Corticosteroids should be used judiciously perioperatively to minimize the risk of complications such as delayed wound healing and infection.\n\nThese recommendations aim to balance the need for optimal disease control with minimizing the risk of perioperative complications in patients with rheumatic diseases undergoing elective joint replacement surgery."

        "pregunta": "2. Why are all recommendations in the guideline considered conditional?",
        "respuesta": "All recommendations in guidelines are considered conditional because they are based on the best available evidence at the time of development, but may not apply universally to every individual or situation. The conditional nature of recommendations acknowledges the need for clinical judgment and consideration of individual patient preferences and circumstances when applying the guideline in practice."

        "pregunta": "3. Which disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are conditionally recommended to be continued through surgery for patients with RA, AS, PsA, JIA, or SLE undergoing elective THA or TKA?",
        "respuesta": "For patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or other rheumatic diseases undergoing elective total hip or knee arthroplasty (THA or TKA), disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and leflunomide are conditionally recommended to be continued through surgery. These medications have been shown to help manage disease activity and reduce the risk of perioperative complications."

        "pregunta": "4. What is the recommendation for withholding biologics, including rituximab, prior to surgery for patients with RA, AS, PsA, or JIA undergoing elective THA or TKA?",
        "respuesta": "The recommendation for withholding biologics, including rituximab, prior to surgery for patients with RA, AS, PsA, or JIA undergoing elective total hip or knee arthroplasty (THA or TKA) is generally advised to reduce the risk of infection and optimize surgical outcomes. Consultation with a rheumatologist or orthopedic surgeon is recommended to determine the appropriate timing for discontinuation of biologic therapy before surgery."

    {
        "pregunta": "5. How should glucocorticoid therapy be managed for patients with RA, AS, PsA, or SLE undergoing THA or TKA?",
        "respuesta": "Glucocorticoid therapy should be carefully managed for patients with RA, AS, PsA, or SLE undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) to minimize the risk of complications such as infection, delayed wound healing, and impaired bone formation. It is generally recommended to taper the glucocorticoid dose prior to surgery to reduce the risk of postoperative complications. Close monitoring and coordination between the orthopedic surgeon and rheumatologist are essential to ensure optimal outcomes for these patients."

        "pregunta": "6. What is the updated recommendation for withholding tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib prior to surgery for patients with RA, AS, PsA, or JIA undergoing THA or TKA?",
        "respuesta": "The updated recommendation for withholding tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib prior to surgery for patients with RA, AS, PsA, or JIA undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is to discontinue these medications at least 7 days before the scheduled surgery to reduce the risk of postoperative complications such as infection."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "7. What medications are conditionally recommended to be withheld for patients with SLE (not severe) undergoing THA or TKA?",
        "respuesta": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are conditionally recommended to be withheld for patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) undergoing total hip or knee arthroplasty (THA or TKA). This is because NSAIDs can potentially exacerbate kidney function and increase the risk of gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with SLE. It is important for healthcare providers to carefully consider the risks and benefits of using NSAIDs in this patient population."

    {
        "pregunta": "8. What is the recommendation for patients with severe SLE undergoing THA or TKA regarding the continuation of belimumab and rituximab?",
        "respuesta": "For patients with severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA), it is generally recommended to continue treatment with belimumab and rituximab to help manage their lupus symptoms and reduce the risk of disease flares. However, the decision to continue these medications should be made in consultation with the patient's rheumatologist and orthopedic surgeon, taking into consideration the individual patient's disease activity, treatment response, and surgical risk factors."

    {
        "pregunta": "9. When should antirheumatic therapy be restarted for patients with RA, AS, PsA, or SLE who underwent total joint arthroplasty?",
        "respuesta": "Antirheumatic therapy should be restarted as soon as possible after total joint arthroplasty for patients with RA, AS, PsA, or SLE to prevent disease flares and maintain disease control. Delaying or discontinuing therapy can increase the risk of disease progression and complications post-surgery. It is important for patients to work closely with their healthcare providers to develop a treatment plan that balances the benefits of antirheumatic therapy with the risks of surgery."

    {
        "pregunta": "10. What is the recommendation for managing glucocorticoid therapy on the day of surgery for patients with RA, AS, PsA, or SLE undergoing THA or TKA?",
        "respuesta": "The recommendation for managing glucocorticoid therapy on the day of surgery for patients with RA, AS, PsA, or SLE undergoing THA or TKA is to continue the glucocorticoid therapy at the patient's usual dose. This is because abrupt withdrawal of glucocorticoids can lead to adrenal insufficiency and potential complications during surgery. It is important to consult with the patient's healthcare team to ensure the appropriate management of glucocorticoid therapy during the perioperative period."
