        "respuesta": "The key guiding principles for determining the optimal timing of elective hip or knee arthroplasty for patients with symptomatic moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis (OA) or advanced symptomatic osteonecrosis (ON) with secondary arthritis are as follows:\n\n1. **Level of Symptoms and Radiographic Severity**: Surgery should be considered for patients with moderate-to-severe pain and loss of function who have radiographically moderate-to-severe OA or advanced ON with secondary arthritis. This assessment should use standard radiographic grading systems such as Kellgren-Lawrence or Tonnis.\n\n2. **Failure of Nonoperative Therapy**: Patients should have completed and not improved with one or more trials of appropriate nonoperative therapies. These treatments include physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and/or intraarticular injections (e.g., glucocorticoids or viscosupplementation).\n\n3. **Shared Decision-Making Process**: The decision to proceed with surgery should be made through a collaborative process between the patient and physician, considering the specifics of the patient’s condition and individual preferences.\n\n4. **Medical Comorbidities Management**:\n   - **Nicotine Cessation**: Surgery should be delayed to achieve nicotine cessation or reduction.\n   - **Glycemic Control**: Improving glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus is recommended before surgery, though no specific measure or threshold is provided.\n   - **Obesity Consideration**: Obesity alone should not delay surgery. There should be no set weight or BMI target for surgery, but weight loss is encouraged.\n\n5. **Specific Conditions Warranting Immediate Surgery**: Surgery should not be delayed in patients with severe deformity, bone loss, or in neuropathic joints despite the stage of pain and functional loss.\n\nThese principles are based on a systematic review process integrating clinical expertise and patient insights.",
