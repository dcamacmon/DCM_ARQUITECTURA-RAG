        "pregunta": "7. How should management of osteoarthritis begin when choosing pharmacologic therapies?",
        "respuesta": "The management of osteoarthritis with pharmacologic therapies typically begins with the use of acetaminophen as the first-line treatment for pain relief, given its safety profile. If acetaminophen is insufficient, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are often considered next, but they should be used with caution due to potential gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal side effects. Topical NSAIDs may be preferred for localized pain, particularly in the knee and hand, due to a lower risk of systemic side effects. In cases where these medications are not effective or appropriate, other options such as intra-articular corticosteroid injections, tramadol, or duloxetine may be considered. It is important to tailor the choice of pharmacologic therapy to the individual patient's needs, comorbidities, and risk factors."
