        "pregunta": "3. Which disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are conditionally recommended to be continued through surgery for patients with RA, AS, PsA, JIA, or SLE undergoing elective THA or TKA?",
        "respuesta": "For patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) undergoing elective total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA), conventional synthetic DMARDs such as methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, and leflunomide are generally conditionally recommended to be continued through surgery. However, specific recommendations can vary based on individual patient factors and the treating physician's clinical judgment. It's important for patients to discuss their specific situation with their healthcare provider."

        "pregunta": "5. How should glucocorticoid therapy be managed for patients with RA, AS, PsA, or SLE undergoing THA or TKA?",
        "respuesta": "For patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA), glucocorticoid therapy should be managed carefully to balance the need for anti-inflammatory effects with the potential risks associated with surgery.\n\n1. **Preoperative Assessment**: Evaluate the patient's current glucocorticoid dose and overall health status. Consider the patient's disease activity and risk factors for adrenal insufficiency.\n\n2. **Perioperative Glucocorticoid Management**: Patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy may require stress dosing around the time of surgery to prevent adrenal insufficiency due to the stress of surgery. This is typically done by providing a higher dose of glucocorticoids during the perioperative period, often using intravenous hydrocortisone.\n\n3. **Tapering and Monitoring**: After surgery, glucocorticoid doses should be carefully tapered back to the patient's baseline maintenance dose. Monitor for signs of adrenal insufficiency or disease flare-ups.\n\n4. **Infection Risk**: Be aware of the increased risk of infection associated with glucocorticoid use, and ensure appropriate prophylactic measures are in place.\n\n5. **Multidisciplinary Approach**: Coordination between rheumatologists, orthopedic surgeons, and anesthesiologists is crucial to optimize glucocorticoid management and patient outcomes.\n\nEach patient's situation may vary, so individual assessment and tailoring of glucocorticoid therapy are important."

        "respuesta": "I don't know the updated recommendation for withholding tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib prior to surgery for patients with RA, AS, PsA, or JIA undergoing THA or TKA. For the most accurate and up-to-date guidelines, it is best to consult medical resources or professional guidelines relevant to these medications and surgical procedures."

        "pregunta": "8. What is the recommendation for patients with severe SLE undergoing THA or TKA regarding the continuation of belimumab and rituximab?",
        "respuesta": "I don't know the specific recommendations for patients with severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) regarding the continuation of belimumab and rituximab. Recommendations can vary based on individual patient circumstances and evolving clinical guidelines. It is important for patients to consult with their healthcare providers to determine the best course of action for their specific situation."

        "pregunta": "9. When should antirheumatic therapy be restarted for patients with RA, AS, PsA, or SLE who underwent total joint arthroplasty?",
        "respuesta": "The timing for restarting antirheumatic therapy after total joint arthroplasty in patients with conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) depends on several factors, including the specific medications being used, the patient's disease activity, and the risk of infection. Generally, non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) can often be restarted within a few days to weeks post-surgery once there is no sign of infection and wound healing is satisfactory. Biologic agents are usually restarted after ensuring proper wound healing and the absence of post-operative complications, which may be a few weeks to a couple of months after surgery. It is important for the patientâ€™s healthcare team to make decisions on a case-by-case basis, considering the individual patient's condition and risk factors. Consulting with the rheumatologist and surgical team is essential for an appropriate plan."

        "pregunta": "10. What is the recommendation for managing glucocorticoid therapy on the day of surgery for patients with RA, AS, PsA, or SLE undergoing THA or TKA?",
        "respuesta": "For patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), ankylosing spondylitis (AS), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who are undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and are on chronic glucocorticoid therapy, the general recommendation is to continue their usual dose of glucocorticoids on the day of surgery. Stress-dose steroids, or additional glucocorticoids, may be considered if the patient is on a high-dose regimen or has been on long-term therapy, to prevent adrenal insufficiency due to perioperative stress. However, specific recommendations can vary and should be individualized based on the patient's clinical condition and the advice of their healthcare provider."
