        "pregunta": "1. What is the recommended treatment approach for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity in rheumatoid arthritis, according to the 2021 American College of Rheumatology guideline?",
        "respuesta": "According to the 2021 American College of Rheumatology guidelines for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, the recommended treatment approach for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity is to start with methotrexate as the initial therapy. If methotrexate is contraindicated or not tolerated, leflunomide or sulfasalazine are considered alternative options. Additionally, the guidelines suggest considering the early use of glucocorticoids as a bridging therapy until the DMARDs take effect, but they emphasize the importance of tapering and discontinuing glucocorticoids as soon as possible."

        "pregunta": "2. In patients with subcutaneous nodules and moderate-to-high disease activity, what is the preferred DMARD therapy based on the guideline?",
        "respuesta": "I don't know the specific guideline you are referring to for the treatment of patients with subcutaneous nodules and moderate-to-high disease activity. However, in general, methotrexate is often the preferred disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) for patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have moderate-to-high disease activity. It is frequently used as a first-line treatment unless contraindicated. For a precise recommendation, it would be best to refer to the specific clinical guideline in question."

        "pregunta": "6. How should healthcare providers manage patients with hepatitis B infection initiating rituximab therapy, as per the guideline?",
        "respuesta": "Healthcare providers managing patients with hepatitis B infection who are initiating rituximab therapy should follow guidelines that typically include screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection prior to starting treatment. Patients identified as having active HBV infection or as carriers should receive antiviral prophylaxis to prevent reactivation of the virus during and after rituximab therapy. This often involves consulting with a hepatologist or infectious disease specialist for appropriate antiviral management. Monitoring of liver function tests and HBV DNA levels during and after treatment is also recommended to detect any signs of reactivation early. Specific guidelines may vary, so it is important to refer to the latest clinical guidelines or consult with specialists for the most current recommendations."
