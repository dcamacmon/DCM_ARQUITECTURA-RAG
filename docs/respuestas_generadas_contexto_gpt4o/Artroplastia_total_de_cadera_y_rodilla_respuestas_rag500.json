        "respuesta": "The key guiding principles for determining the optimal timing of elective hip or knee arthroplasty for patients with symptomatic moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis or advanced symptomatic osteonecrosis with secondary arthritis, based on the provided guidelines, include:\n\n1. **Ineffectiveness of Nonoperative Therapy**: Surgery is considered when nonoperative treatments have been ineffective in managing the patient's symptoms and the patient has elected to undergo surgical intervention.\n\n2. **Shared Decision-Making**: The decision to proceed with surgery should involve a thorough shared decision-making process between the patient and their physician. This includes evaluating the patient's symptoms, preferences, and overall health status.\n\n3. **Medical Comorbidities and Risk Factors**: Recommendations are provided regarding the timing of surgery, particularly in patients with specific medical comorbidities and risk factors. This includes addressing issues such as nicotine cessation, improved glycemic control, and other modifiable risk factors to optimize medical conditions before surgery.\n\n4. **Avoidance of Unnecessary Delay**: While addressing risk factors, unnecessary delays in surgery should be avoided as they can increase the technical difficulty of the procedure and do not improve surgical outcomes.\n\nThese principles aim to ensure the best possible outcomes for patients by timing the surgery appropriately and considering all relevant health factors.",
