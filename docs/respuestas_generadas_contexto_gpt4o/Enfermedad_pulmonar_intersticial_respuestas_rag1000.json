While evaluation of ambulatory desaturation is considered inexpensive and informs a patient's need for supplemental oxygen, it is not routinely practiced by many rheumatologists. However, pulmonologists may perform this test in their offices, and it could be offered in specific cases, such as patients with inadequate pulmonary function test (PFT) quality, those unable to perform PFTs, or those with associated pulmonary hypertension.

DISCUSSION This guideline provides recommendations to clinicians for ILD screening and monitoring in people with RA, SSc, IIM, MCTD, and SjD. PFTs (including spirometry, lung volumes, and DLCO) and HRCT chest are conditionally recommended for the screening of ILD in people with these SARDs, whereas PFTs, HRCT chest, and ambulatory desaturation testing are conditionally recommended for the monitoring of people with SARD-ILD. There are limited to no roles for chest radiography, 6MWD, bronchoscopy, or surgical lung biopsy for the routine screening or monitoring of people with SARD-ILD.

Given feasibility concerns in rheumatology outpatient practices, routine ambulatory desaturation testing was not recommended as a screening test. Within pulmonary outpatient practices and/or interdisciplinary models of shared care, ambulatory desaturation testing is more feasible and can be more easily offered in selected patients such as those with inadequate PFT quality, those who are unable to perform PFTs, or those with associated pulmonary hypertension. For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with bronchoscopy.

For people with SARD-ILD, we suggest monitoring for ambulatory desaturation every 3 to 12 months. There was a discrepancy between the application of this clinical assessment by rheumatologists and pulmonologists. Testing for ambulatory desaturation is inexpensive and informs a patient's need for supplemental oxygen. However, evaluation of ambulatory desaturation is not routine practice for many rheumatologists, and there may be operational challenges in performing ambulatory desaturation testing in some rheumatology offices.
