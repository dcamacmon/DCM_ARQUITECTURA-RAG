The key steps include:\n\n1. **Safe and Specific Approach:** Begin by adopting a safe and specific approach to ascertain the PMR case definition. This involves conducting a thorough clinical evaluation to exclude relevant mimicking conditions, such as giant cell arteritis or rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n2. **Use of Glucocorticoids:** Prioritize the use of glucocorticoids (GCs) over non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for treatment. The guidelines strongly recommend GCs due to their effectiveness in managing PMR symptoms and the potential adverse effects associated with long-term NSAID use.\n\n3. **Medication Dosage and Tapering:** Follow recommended dosing guidelines, starting with an initial prednisone dose of 12.5 to 25 mg daily, and tailor the dose-tapering schedules to the individual patient. Tapering should be gradual, with regular monitoring to assess response and adjust as necessary.\n\n4. **Individualized Treatment Plans:** Emphasize individualized care by considering each patient's risk factors for GC-related adverse events, comorbidities, and potential for relapses. Treatment plans should be flexible to accommodate the varying needs of patients.\n\n5. **Long-term Management:** Consider long-term management strategies, particularly for patients who may require low-dose glucocorticoids to maintain disease quiescence.
