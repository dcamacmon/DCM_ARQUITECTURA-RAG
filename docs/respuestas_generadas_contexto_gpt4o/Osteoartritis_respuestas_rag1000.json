Patient participants on the Patient and Voting Panels raised the concern that patients who are in pain might be hesitant to participate in exercise. There is no uniformly accepted level of pain at which a patient should or should not exercise, and a common-sense approach of shared decision-making between the treating clinician and the patient regarding when to initiate an exercise program is advisable. However, clinical trials of exercise for OA include patients with pain and functional limitations due to OA, and improvements in OA-specific outcomes have been demonstrated; thus, results are likely to be generalizable to most patients with pain due to OA. Although there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend one form of exercise over another, patients will likely benefit from advice that is as",

        "pregunta": "9. Why is a multimodal treatment plan preferred over a single medication approach for managing osteoarthritis?",
        "respuesta": "A multimodal treatment plan is preferred over a single medication approach for managing osteoarthritis because it addresses the broader impact of osteoarthritis on symptoms such as mood disorders, including depression and anxiety, altered sleep, chronic widespread pain, and impaired coping skills. A multimodal approach that includes measures aimed at improving mood, reducing stress, addressing insomnia, managing weight, and enhancing fitness can improve the patient's overall well-being and enhance the success of osteoarthritis treatment. Interventions beneficial in chronic pain management may also prove useful in osteoarthritis. By employing a combination of physical, psychosocial, mind-body, and pharmacologic interventions, tailored to the specific needs and preferences of the patient, a more comprehensive and effective management strategy is achieved. This approach not only focuses on symptom control but also considers the individual variability in response to treatments, making it more adaptable and patient-centered.",

Important directions for research include gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the optimal types of exercises and the modifications that should be used based on disease location and severity, study of the intensity of exercise that would be optimal for a given individual ( https ://health.gov/pagui In conclusion, optimal management requires a comprehensive, multimodal approach to treating patients with hand, hip, and/ or knee OA offered in the context of shared decision-making with patients, to choose the safest and most effective treatment possible.

For some patients with more limited disease in whom medication is required, topical NSAIDs represent an appropriate first choice. For others, particularly with hip OA or polyarticular involvement, oral NSAIDs are more appropriate. The appropriate use of other oral agents, particularly acetaminophen and opioids, will continue to evolve Despite the many options available, some patients may continue to experience inadequate symptom control; others will experience adverse effects from the available interventions. Clinicians treating patients in these circumstances should choose interventions with a low risk of harm, but both clinicians",

Physical, psychosocial, and mind-body approaches (Table 1) During the GRADE analysis, clinical trials involving physical modalities and mind-body approaches were often designated as yielding low-quality evidence because blinding with regard to the active treatment was not always possible. This contributed to a preponderance of conditional recommendations for physical modalities and mind-body approaches.
