        "respuesta": "The information emphasizes the importance of reassessing fracture risk in patients who are continuing chronic glucocorticoid therapy due to several key reasons. Reassessment allows healthcare providers to determine if patients are maintaining, gaining, or losing bone mineral density (BMD), which can inform potential changes in osteoporosis (OP) therapy. This process is crucial for patients who are at moderate, high, or very high fracture risk and are continuing both glucocorticoid (GC) and OP therapy. Such reassessment should occur every 1 to 2 years over no risk reassessment, despite the low certainty of evidence, as it is considered good clinical practice. Additionally, for adults stopping GC and remaining at moderate, high, or very high fracture risk, continuing OP therapy is strongly recommended.
