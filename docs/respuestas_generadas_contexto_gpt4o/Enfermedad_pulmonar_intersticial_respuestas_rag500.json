            "66% specific), despite very low certainty of evidence (one observational study), For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend screening with HRCT chest over history and physical examination or PFTs alone. Very low-certainty evidence suggests that the HRCT chest has a sensitivity of 95.7% and specificity of 63.8% for the detection of ILD (≥20% extent of lung involvement). Low-certainty evidence from five observational studies suggests that PFTs alone may",

            "between rheumatology and pulmonology. Thus, some recommendations will comment on potential variations in practice between these specialties. For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend monitoring with PFTs. PFTs (spirometry, volumes, and DLCO) provide objective data that are helpful in following patients over time. Patients saw benefit in an objective test to help assess disease stability or progression. Although PFTs can reassure both patient and clinician when they are stable,"
