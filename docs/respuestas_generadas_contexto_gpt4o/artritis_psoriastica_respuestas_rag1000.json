        "respuesta": "The severity of Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) is considered a broader concept than disease activity and encompasses both the level of disease activity at a given time point and the presence of poor prognostic factors and long-term damage. Examples of severe PsA include the presence of one or more of the following: a poor prognostic factor (such as erosive disease, elevated markers of inflammation like C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate attributable to PsA), long-term damage that interferes with function (e.g., joint deformities, vision loss), or highly active disease that causes major impairment in quality of life (active psoriatic inflammatory disease at many sites).\n\nThe guideline development group acknowledges that there are currently no widely agreed-upon definitions of disease severity in PsA or psoriasis. Therefore, the severity should be judged by the healthcare provider and patient on a case-by-case basis. This individualized assessment is crucial as it directly impacts treatment decisions. The lack of standardized definitions emphasizes the need for personalized treatment plans that take into account all active disease domains, comorbidities, and the patient's functional status, ensuring that therapy is optimally tailored to the specific circumstances of the patient at any given point in time.",

A strong recommendation means that the panel was confident that the desirable effects of following the recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects (or vice versa), so the course of action would apply to all or almost all patients, and only a small proportion of clinicians/patients not wanting to follow the recommendation.
