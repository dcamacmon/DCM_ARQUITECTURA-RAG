This is a good practice statement.\n\n2. **Repellents to Prevent Tick Bites**: For the prevention of tick bites, the guidelines strongly recommend the use of N, N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), picaridin, ethyl-3-(Nn-butyl-N-acetyl) aminopropionate (IR3535), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), p-methane-3,8-diol (PMD), 2-undecanone, or permethrin. This recommendation is based on moderate-quality evidence.\n\n3. **Removal of Attached Ticks**: The guidelines recommend promptly removing attached ticks by mechanical means using a clean fine-tipped tweezer (or a comparable device) inserted between the tick body and the skin. This is a good practice statement.\n\nThe guidelines also recommend against burning an attached tick with a match or other heat device or applying noxious chemicals or petroleum products to coax its detachment.",

Comment: If needed, the convalescent-phase serum sample should be collected at least 2-3 weeks after collection of the acute-phase serum sample. VI. What are the preferred antibiotic regimens for the treatment of erythema migrans? Recommendation: 1. For patients with erythema migrans, we recommend using oral antibiotic therapy with doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Comment: For patients unable to take both doxycycline and beta-lactam antibiotics, the preferred second-line agent is azithromycin. VII. How long should a patient with erythema migrans be treated?

Comment: If azithromycin is used, the indicated duration is 5-10 days, with a 7-day course preferred in the United States, as this duration of therapy was used in the largest clinical trial performed in the United States . VIII. Should patients with the southern tickassociated rash illness (STARI) be treated with antibiotics? Recommendation: 1. In patients who develop an erythema migrans-like skin lesion following the bite of the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum), an illness referred to as STARI, we make no recommendation for or against the use of antibiotics (no recommendation; knowledge gap).

Comment: Doxycycline is given as a single oral dose, 200 mg for adults and 4.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 200 mg) for children. V. What is the preferred diagnostic testing strategy for erythema migrans? Recommendations: 1. In patients with potential tick exposure in a Lyme disease endemic area who have 1 or more skin lesions compatible with erythema migrans, we recommend clinical diagnosis rather than laboratory testing (strong recommendation, moderatequality evidence). 2. In patients with 1 or more skin lesions suggestive of, but atypical for erythema migrans, we suggest antibody testing performed on an acute-phase serum sample (followed by a convalescent-phase serum sample if the initial result is negative) rather than currently available direct detection methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR)",

For patients who have persistent or recurring nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, pain, or cognitive impairment following recommended treatment for Lyme disease, but who lack objective evidence of reinfection or treatment failure, we recommend against additional antibiotic therapy (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).
