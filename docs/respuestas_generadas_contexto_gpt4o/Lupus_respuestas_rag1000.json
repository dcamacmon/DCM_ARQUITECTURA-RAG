If initial dual therapy was used, it should be escalated to triple therapy. If initial triple therapy was used, changing to an alternative triple therapy or considering the addition of an anti-CD20 agent as a second immunosuppressive is advised.\n\nFor those with refractory disease (having failed two standard therapy courses), it is conditionally recommended to escalate treatment to a more intensive regimen. This may include the addition of anti-CD20 agents, combination therapy with three non-glucocorticoid immunosuppressives (e.g., mycophenolic acid analogs, belimumab, and calcineurin inhibitors), or referral for investigational therapy.",
