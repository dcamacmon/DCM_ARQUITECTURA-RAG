This is considered a good practice statement.\n\n2. **Repellents**: For the prevention of tick bites, the guidelines recommend using repellents such as N, N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), picaridin, ethyl-3-(Nn-butyl-N-acetyl) aminopropionate (IR3535), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), p-methane-3,8-diol (PMD), 2-undecanone, or permethrin.
