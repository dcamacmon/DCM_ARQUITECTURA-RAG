        "pregunta": "1. What is the recommended frequency for screening people with SLE for proteinuria in the absence of known kidney disease?",
        "respuesta": "For individuals with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who do not have known kidney disease, it is generally recommended to screen for proteinuria at regular intervals, typically during routine follow-up visits. This often translates to screening at least annually, or more frequently if clinically indicated, to monitor for the development of lupus nephritis. However, specific guidelines may vary, so it is important for patients to follow the recommendations of their healthcare provider."

        "pregunta": "2. When is a kidney biopsy strongly recommended in people with SLE suspected of having lupus nephritis?",
        "respuesta": "A kidney biopsy is strongly recommended in people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) suspected of having lupus nephritis when there is evidence of significant kidney involvement. This can include persistent proteinuria (usually greater than 0.5 grams per day), active urinary sediment (presence of red blood cells, white blood cells, or cellular casts in the urine), unexplained decline in kidney function (elevated serum creatinine), or when the clinical presentation is atypical or does not respond to initial treatment. The biopsy helps in diagnosing the specific type and severity of lupus nephritis, which guides appropriate treatment strategies."

        "pregunta": "3. What is the preferred therapy regimen for lupus nephritis according to the ACR guideline?",
        "respuesta": "I don't know the current preferred therapy regimen for lupus nephritis according to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines, as guidelines can change over time. It's best to consult the latest ACR guidelines or a medical professional for the most accurate and up-to-date information."

        "pregunta": "4. How should medication dosages be adjusted in individuals with decreased GFR at the initiation of lupus nephritis therapy?",
        "respuesta": "In individuals with decreased glomerular filtration rate (GFR) at the initiation of lupus nephritis therapy, medication dosages often need to be adjusted to prevent toxicity and ensure efficacy. This is because reduced kidney function can affect the clearance of medications. Here are some general considerations:\n\n1. **Renally Adjusted Drugs**: Medications that are primarily excreted by the kidneys, such as certain immunosuppressants and corticosteroids, may require dosage adjustments. The specific adjustment depends on the degree of renal impairment.\n\n2. **Monitoring**: Close monitoring of drug levels, where applicable, and clinical response is crucial in patients with decreased GFR to tailor the dose appropriately.\n\n3. **Consultation**: It is important to consult dosing guidelines and possibly a nephrologist or clinical pharmacist when making adjustments, as they can provide guidance based on the latest evidence and patient-specific factors.\n\n4. **Avoid Nephrotoxic Drugs**: Medications that have the potential to further impair renal function should be used with caution or avoided if possible.\n\n5. **Individualized Approach**: Each patient should be evaluated individually, considering factors such as the specific medication used, the patient's overall health status, and any comorbid conditions.\n\nUltimately, the goal is to optimize therapy while minimizing adverse effects, and careful consideration of renal function is a key component in achieving this balance in lupus nephritis treatment."

        "pregunta": "5. When should adjunctive treatment with systemic anticoagulation be considered for individuals with lupus nephritis?",
        "respuesta": "Systemic anticoagulation as an adjunctive treatment for individuals with lupus nephritis should be considered in specific circumstances, such as when there is a high risk of thromboembolic events. This risk can be elevated in patients with antiphospholipid syndrome, which is commonly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). In such cases, the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies may necessitate anticoagulation to prevent thrombosis. Each patient's situation should be evaluated individually, considering factors like their history of thrombosis, the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, and other risk factors for clotting. It is important for patients to be assessed by a healthcare provider to determine the appropriate use of anticoagulation therapy."

        "pregunta": "7. In individuals with active or new onset lupus nephritis Class V, what is the recommended treatment for proteinuria levels above 1 g/g?",
        "respuesta": "In individuals with active or new-onset lupus nephritis Class V (membranous lupus nephritis) with proteinuria levels above 1 g/g, the treatment typically includes immunosuppressive therapy combined with measures to control proteinuria. A common approach is to use corticosteroids in combination with other immunosuppressive agents such as mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) or cyclophosphamide. Additionally, adjunctive therapies like angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are often recommended to help reduce proteinuria and manage blood pressure. It is important for treatment to be tailored to the individual patient, taking into account the severity of the disease and other patient-specific factors."

        "pregunta": "8. How should non-responsive or refractory lupus nephritis be managed according to the ACR guideline?",
        "respuesta": "I don't know the specific details of the most recent ACR guidelines on the management of non-responsive or refractory lupus nephritis. However, generally, management may involve changing or escalating immunosuppressive therapy, considering biologic agents such as rituximab or belimumab, and ensuring optimal supportive care. Consulting the latest ACR guidelines directly would provide the most accurate and detailed recommendations."

        "pregunta": "9. What is the suggested escalation of treatment for individuals with inadequate renal response to initial DUAL therapy?",
        "respuesta": "I don't know."

    {
        "pregunta": "10. When should referral for investigational therapy be considered in individuals with refractory lupus nephritis?",
        "respuesta": "Referral for investigational therapy in individuals with refractory lupus nephritis should be considered when the patient does not respond adequately to standard treatments, such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents like cyclophosphamide or mycophenolate mofetil. This is particularly important when the disease remains active and poses a significant risk to kidney function and overall health. Investigational therapies may include clinical trials for novel treatments that could offer new mechanisms of action or improved efficacy. It is crucial to consider such referrals in specialized centers with experience in managing complex lupus nephritis cases and access to appropriate clinical trials."
