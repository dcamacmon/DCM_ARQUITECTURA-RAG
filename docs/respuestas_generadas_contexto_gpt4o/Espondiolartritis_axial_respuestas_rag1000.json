Recommendations for the treatment of patients with active AS In adults with active AS, we conditionally recommend continuous treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) over on-demand treatment with NSAIDs (PICO 1). The efficacy of NSAIDs for symptom improvement in active AS has been established in many controlled trials. Evidence that continuous NSAID use results in slower rates of spinal fusion on radiographs over 2 years compared to on-demand NSAID use is inconsistent, with results of one trial of",

Spine and/or pelvis MRI could aid in the evaluation of patients in whom the degree of active inflammation is uncertain, and especially in those for whom the findings would change management. MRI is not recommended to seek subclinical inflammation in patients with stable disease (as defined in Table 1 We used the GRADE method to develop these treatment recommendations in a way that was transparent, systematic, and explicit, and that was informed by the medical evidence as well as patient preferences. The major limitation of these guidelines is the very low quality of evidence for many recommendations, which necessitated reliance on the clinical expertise of the panel.
