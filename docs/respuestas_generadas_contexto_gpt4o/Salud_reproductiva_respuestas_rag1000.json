This approach aims to control severe life-threatening or organ-threatening maternal disease before pregnancy.\n\n2. **During Pregnancy**: If a woman becomes pregnant, rituximab can be continued if there is severe life-threatening or organ-threatening maternal disease that mandates its use. However, caution is advised as dosing in the second half of pregnancy puts the fetus at high risk of having minimal B cells at delivery.\n\nThese recommendations reflect the need to balance disease control against potential risks to the fetus, taking into account the limited available data on rituximab use during pregnancy.",
