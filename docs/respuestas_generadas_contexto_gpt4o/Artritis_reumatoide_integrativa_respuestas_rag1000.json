        "respuesta": "According to the 2022 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline, the key recommendations for exercise in the management of rheumatoid arthritis are:\n\n1. Consistent engagement in exercise is strongly recommended over no exercise, based on moderate certainty evidence that suggests regular exercise results in improved physical function and pain for individuals with rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n2. Aerobic exercise is conditionally recommended over no exercise, although the certainty of evidence for this recommendation is very low to low.\n\n3. Aquatic exercise is conditionally recommended over no exercise, with a low certainty of evidence.\n\n4. Resistance exercise is conditionally recommended over no exercise, with a very low certainty of evidence.\n\n5. Mind–body exercise is also conditionally recommended over no exercise, based on very low to low certainty of evidence.\n\nThe guidelines emphasize that the exercise type, frequency, intensity, and duration should be tailored to each individual, considering their capabilities, access to resources, and other health conditions. National physical activity guidelines can aid in providing tailored exercise instructions.",

        "respuesta": "According to the 2022 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline, the use of thermal modalities in the management of rheumatoid arthritis is conditionally recommended over no thermal modalities. This recommendation is based on very low certainty of evidence. Thermal modalities, such as cryotherapy, heat, and therapeutic ultrasound, have been found to result in improvements in pain and physical function for individuals with rheumatoid arthritis. The guideline notes that individuals with rheumatoid arthritis receive varying levels of benefit from thermal modalities, and patient preferences may differ regarding the choice of a specific thermal modality. Many of these modalities can be controlled and administered by the patients themselves at home, although some individuals may benefit from guidance from an occupational or physical therapist.",
