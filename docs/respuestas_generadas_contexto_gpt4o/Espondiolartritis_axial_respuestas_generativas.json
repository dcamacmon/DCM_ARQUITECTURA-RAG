        "pregunta": "1. What is the recommended treatment for adults with nonradiographic axial SpA who have active disease despite NSAID treatment?",
        "respuesta": "For adults with nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (axial SpA) who have active disease despite treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the recommended next step is typically the use of biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs). Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors or interleukin-17 (IL-17) inhibitors are commonly used options. The decision to start bDMARDs should be made in consultation with a rheumatologist, considering the individual patient's disease activity and response to previous treatments."

        "pregunta": "2. When should treatment with TNFi be considered in adults with nonradiographic axial SpA?",
        "respuesta": "Treatment with TNF inhibitors (TNFi) should be considered in adults with nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (axial SpA) when the following criteria are met:\n\n1. **Diagnosis Confirmation**: The diagnosis of nonradiographic axial SpA has been confirmed based on clinical evaluation and imaging studies, such as MRI, which show inflammation but not the radiographic changes associated with ankylosing spondylitis.\n\n2. **Inadequate Response to NSAIDs**: The patient has had an inadequate response to at least two different nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) taken at optimal doses over a period of time. NSAIDs are typically the first line of treatment for managing symptoms in axial SpA.\n\n3. **Active Disease**: There is evidence of active disease, often assessed using measures like the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) or C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, indicating ongoing inflammation and symptoms.\n\n4. **Consideration of Other Treatments**: Before initiating TNFi therapy, other potential treatments, such as physical therapy and patient education, should have been considered or attempted.\n\n5. **Exclusion of Contraindications**: There should be no contraindications to TNFi therapy, such as active infections or certain other medical conditions.\n\nThe decision to start TNFi therapy should be individualized and made in collaboration with a rheumatologist, taking into account the patient's overall health, preferences, and specific disease characteristics."

        "pregunta": "3. What are the recommended medications for adults with active nonradiographic axial SpA who have contraindications to TNFi?",
        "respuesta": "For adults with active nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) who have contraindications to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), alternative treatments may include interleukin-17 (IL-17) inhibitors, such as secukinumab or ixekizumab. These medications have shown efficacy in treating axial SpA and can be considered when TNFi are not suitable. It's essential for healthcare providers to tailor treatment plans based on individual patient needs and medical history. Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice."

        "pregunta": "4. In adults with isolated active sacroiliitis despite NSAID treatment, what is the recommended approach for glucocorticoid treatment?",
        "respuesta": "In adults with isolated active sacroiliitis who do not respond adequately to NSAID treatment, local glucocorticoid injections directly into the sacroiliac joint can be considered as a therapeutic option. This approach targets the inflammation locally and can provide relief from symptoms. Systemic glucocorticoids are generally not recommended for isolated sacroiliitis due to their broader range of side effects. It is important for patients to be evaluated by a healthcare professional to determine the most appropriate treatment plan based on their individual condition."

        "pregunta": "8. What is the recommended approach for assessing disease activity in adults with nonradiographic axial SpA?",
        "respuesta": "The recommended approach for assessing disease activity in adults with nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) typically involves a combination of clinical assessment, patient-reported outcomes, and imaging techniques. Key components include:\n\n1. **Clinical Assessment**: Evaluation of symptoms such as back pain, stiffness, and fatigue, along with a physical examination to assess spinal mobility and peripheral joint involvement.\n\n2. **Patient-Reported Outcomes**: Use of standardized questionnaires like the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) to capture the patient's perspective on disease activity.\n\n3. **Imaging**: MRI is often used to detect inflammation in the sacroiliac joints and the spine, especially since nonradiographic axial SpA may not show changes on X-rays.\n\n4. **Laboratory Tests**: In some cases, tests for inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) can be useful, although they are not always elevated in nonradiographic axial SpA.\n\nA comprehensive assessment using these methods helps in monitoring disease activity and guiding treatment decisions."

        "pregunta": "9. In adults with nonradiographic axial SpA of unclear activity while on a biologic, what imaging study is recommended?",
        "respuesta": "In adults with nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) of unclear activity while on a biologic, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically recommended. MRI is useful in assessing inflammatory activity, such as bone marrow edema, which may not be visible on plain radiographs. It provides detailed images of both bone and soft tissue, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of disease activity."
