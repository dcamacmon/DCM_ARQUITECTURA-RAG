1. Why should screening for ILD not be limited only to patients with identified risk factors in systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs)?
2. Which screening methods are conditionally recommended against for ILD in SARD patients?
3. What systemic manifestations in mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) are associated with higher ILD risk?
4. Why is screening with chest radiography conditionally recommended against in patients with SARDs at risk for ILD?
5. How does the progression and monitoring frequency of rheumatoid arthritis-associated ILD (RA-ILD) differ from that of other SARD-ILDs?
6. How does disease activity in SARDs influence the monitoring frequency of associated ILD?
7. Why is the 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) test conditionally recommended against for routine monitoring in patients with SARD-ILD?
8. What are the recommended screening tests for ILD in patients with SARDs at increased risk?
9. How often are PFTs suggested for monitoring ILD progression in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathy-associated ILD (IIM-ILD) and systemic sclerosis-associated ILD (SSc-ILD) during the first year?
10. What monitoring methods are conditionally recommended against for ILD progression in patients with SARDs-ILD?
11. What factors influence the frequency of monitoring in patients with SARD-ILD?

13. How do the recommendations differ between screening and monitoring strategies for ILD in patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases?
14. How does the combination of HRCT and PFTs compare to PFTs alone for screening patients at increased risk of ILD?
15. What are the advantages and limitations of using PFTs for monitoring ILD progression in SARD patients?
16. What criteria might prompt a clinician to perform HRCT in a patient with SARDs-ILD, despite the lack of specific guidance on routine frequency?
17. Why is chest radiography not recommended as a screening test for ILD in patients with SARDs?
18. What screening method is conditionally recommended over history and physical examination alone for patients with SARDs at increased ILD risk?
19. Why might patients with Sjögren’s syndrome-associated ILD (SjD-ILD) require varied monitoring frequencies?
