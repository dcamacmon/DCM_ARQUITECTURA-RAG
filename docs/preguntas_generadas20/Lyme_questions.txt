12. The provided text appears to be a disclosures section from a clinical guideline document related to Lyme disease, listing conflicts of interest and funding sources of various experts. It does not contain clinical content, recommendations, or key concepts about Lyme disease itself. Therefore, it is not possible to generate meaningful clinical knowledge assessment questions specifically about Lyme disease based solely on this text.
13. However, based on general knowledge of Lyme disease clinical guidelines, here are 20 example questions that could be used to assess medical knowledge about Lyme disease:
14. What are the indications for intravenous antibiotic therapy in Lyme disease?
15. Describe the geographic regions in the United States where Lyme disease is most endemic.
16. Should patients with persistent nonspecific symptoms following standard Lyme disease treatment receive additional antibiotic therapy in the absence of objective evidence of reinfection or treatment failure?
17. How is Lyme disease diagnosed in patients presenting with late manifestations such as Lyme arthritis?
18. What is the preferred antibiotic regimen for chemoprophylaxis following a high-risk Ixodes tick bite?
19. Is routine antibiotic prophylaxis recommended after a tick bite? Under what conditions?
20. What are common neurological complications of Lyme disease?
