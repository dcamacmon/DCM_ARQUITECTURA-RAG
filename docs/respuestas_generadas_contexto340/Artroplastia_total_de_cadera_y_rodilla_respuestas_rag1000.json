Este proceso debe incluir una discusión integral de los riesgos y beneficios específicos para ese paciente en particular. Además, aunque se recomienda aconsejar sobre la optimización previa de factores de riesgo como la pérdida de peso, control glucémico o cesación tabáquica, no se apoyan umbrales rígidos o límites inflexibles (por ejemplo, valores específicos de IMC o HbA1c) que puedan limitar el acceso a la cirugía.\n\nEn resumen, la toma de decisiones compartida garantiza una valoración individualizada y centrada en el paciente, considerando tanto la evidencia disponible como las circunstancias y preferencias personales para determinar el momento más adecuado para la TJA.",

Patients who have neuropathic joints in the early stages of their disease may not have major pain or loss of function but may have severe joint destruction. As the disease progresses, patients develop pain, and the extent of bone loss and joint destruction worsens. These procedures are more technically challenging and often necessitate the use of more constrained implants typically reserved for revision arthroplasty. Proceeding with operative treatment in these cases is recommended because delaying surgery increases the technical difficulty of the procedure and does not improve outcomes after the procedure DISCUSSION This guideline provides evidence-based recommendations regarding the optimal timing of elective TJA in patients who have symptomatic moderate-to-severe OA or advanced symptomatic ON with secondary arthritis who have chosen to undergo surgical treatment after a shared-decision making process with their physician",
            "In these patients, delaying TJA may lead to increased instability and increased juxtaarticular bone loss or deformity, which may increase the technical difficulty of the procedure as well as increase the risk of failure and need for revision. Although patients who have severe bone loss, deformity, or instability have an increased risk of revision or reoperation, this risk will likely only increase over time, with further delay in surgery. Thus, timely TJA should be performed in these cases when medically appropriate. This recommendation is conditional because of the very low quality of evidence. In our defined population with a neuropathic joint, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying for optimization of non-life-threatening conditions. There was no evidence for this recommendation; thus the recommendation is based on clinician and patient opinion and experiences. Patients who have neuropathic joints in the early stages of their disease may not have",

However, it is not uncommon for patients to have their surgical procedure delayed by a third party for additional nonoperative treatment, creating a major barrier to care. In an 8-year follow-up study of 3,417 knees deemed appropriate for TKA, Ghomrawi et al found that only 9% underwent a timely TKA (defined as within 2 years of meeting appropriateness criteria) As noted, TJA is the only approved definitive therapy for moderate-to-severe symptomatic OA of the hip or knee, yet racial disparities in arthroplasty utilization have persisted for decades The Patient Panel was instrumental in the development of this guideline and provided valuable insight into how best to apply these recommendations in the clinical setting. In particular, the Patient Panel stressed the importance of the shared decisionmaking process when indicating a patient for TJA.

        "respuesta": "La guía reconoce la existencia de heterogeneidad entre las poblaciones con osteoartritis (OA) y osteonecrosis (ON) con artritis secundaria en cuanto al momento quirúrgico, ya que incluyen en su población pacientes con osteoartritis de rodilla o cadera, y osteonecrosis con artritis secundaria de rodilla o cadera. Sin embargo, debido a la falta de evidencia que demuestre diferencias en los resultados clínicos según el tipo de articulación (cadera versus rodilla) y la patología subyacente (OA versus ON con artritis secundaria), estas poblaciones fueron agrupadas y tratadas conjuntamente en las recomendaciones sobre el momento óptimo para la artroplastia total electiva.  \n\nEn otras palabras, a pesar de la clara heterogeneidad clínica, no se encontraron datos suficientes que justificaran separar las recomendaciones por subgrupos, por lo que el abordaje es general para ambas condiciones combinadas en un solo grupo poblacional.  \n\nPor tanto, la guía aborda esta heterogeneidad mediante el consenso clínico para agrupar estas poblaciones debido a la ausencia de evidencia que muestre diferencias en los desenlaces relevantes respecto al momento quirúrgico.",

Another limitation of the guideline is that we grouped several separate populations for our PICO questions (e.g., knee OA, hip OA, hip ON with secondary arthritis, and knee ON with secondary arthritis) based on a clinical consensus from the orthopedic surgeons and the rheumatologists on the Core Team and lack of knowledge of the proportion of cases of ON with secondary arthritis that would be included in the literature review, with an understanding that subgroups might be created if evidence of differences in clinical outcomes was found by joint type (hip versus knee) and pathology (OA versus ON with secondary arthritis). No such evidence was found, and therefore, these were treated as a group despite the clear heterogeneity of the populations. Additional cost to the patient and cost effectiveness of nonoperative treatments were considered when the recommendations were made, but these were made based on a priori assumptions because there was a lack",
