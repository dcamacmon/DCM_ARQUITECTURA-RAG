        "pregunta": "1. When is spinal or pelvis MRI recommended to assess disease activity in adults with AS on biologic therapy?",
        "respuesta": "Spinal or pelvis MRI is recommended to assess disease activity in adults with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) on biologic therapy when there is clinical suspicion of active inflammation despite treatment, such as persistent or worsening symptoms, or when there is a need to evaluate for structural progression or confirm active inflammation that is not evident on clinical or laboratory assessment. MRI can detect active inflammatory lesions (bone marrow edema) and help guide treatment decisions."

        "pregunta": "2. What are the current recommendations regarding the use of tofacitinib in axial SpA management?",
        "respuesta": "Current recommendations generally do not include tofacitinib as a first-line treatment for axial spondyloarthritis (axial SpA). While tofacitinib, a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor, has shown some efficacy in clinical trials for axial SpA, it is not yet widely endorsed in major guidelines such as those from the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis international Society (ASAS) or the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR). Typically, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are first-line, followed by biologic DMARDs like tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) or interleukin-17 inhibitors (IL-17i). Tofacitinib may be considered in cases where patients have an inadequate response or intolerance to these established therapies, but its use remains off-label or limited pending further evidence and guideline updates. Always consult current clinical guidelines and specialists for the most up-to-date recommendations."

        "pregunta": "3. What does the guideline say about the use of NSAIDs in adults with inflammatory bowel disease and axial spondyloarthritis?",
        "respuesta": "The guideline generally advises caution with the use of NSAIDs in adults who have both inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and axial spondyloarthritis. While NSAIDs are effective for managing axial spondyloarthritis symptoms, they may exacerbate IBD symptoms or lead to disease flares. Therefore, NSAIDs should be used at the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration possible, with close monitoring for any worsening of IBD. Alternative treatments may be considered to manage axial symptoms while minimizing gastrointestinal risks."

        "pregunta": "4. How is unsupervised back exercise viewed in the management of axial spondyloarthritis according to the guideline?",
        "respuesta": "According to current guidelines for the management of axial spondyloarthritis, unsupervised back exercise is generally not recommended as the primary approach. Supervised exercise programs, often guided by physiotherapists, are preferred because they ensure correct technique, optimize benefits, and reduce the risk of injury. Unsupervised exercises may be less effective and could potentially lead to improper movements or exacerbation of symptoms. Therefore, supervised back exercise is emphasized for better management outcomes in axial spondyloarthritis."

    {
        "pregunta": "5. What is the difference between a strong recommendation and a conditional recommendation in these guidelines?",
        "respuesta": "A strong recommendation indicates that the guideline developers are confident that the desirable effects of an intervention clearly outweigh the undesirable effects (or vice versa), and most informed patients would choose that option. It suggests that the recommendation should be followed in most circumstances.\n\nA conditional recommendation means that the desirable effects probably outweigh the undesirable effects, but there is less certainty. It implies that different choices may be appropriate for different patients, and clinicians should help patients make decisions consistent with their values and preferences."

    {
        "pregunta": "6. How should biologic therapy be managed in terms of continuation, tapering, or discontinuation in axial SpA patients?",
        "respuesta": "In axial spondyloarthritis (axial SpA), biologic therapy (such as TNF inhibitors or IL-17 inhibitors) is typically continued long-term to maintain disease control and prevent structural damage. Discontinuation may lead to relapse in many patients. Tapering (dose reduction or increasing dosing intervals) can be considered in patients who have sustained remission or low disease activity for an extended period, but this should be done cautiously with close monitoring for flare. Complete discontinuation is generally not recommended unless there are compelling reasons (e.g., adverse effects, patient preference), and if stopped, patients should be monitored closely for disease recurrence. Decisions should be individualized based on disease activity, patient symptoms, and risk factors."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "7. What is secondary nonresponse in the context of axial spondyloarthritis treatment?",
        "respuesta": "Secondary nonresponse in the context of axial spondyloarthritis treatment refers to the situation where a patient initially responds well to a therapy, such as a biologic agent (e.g., TNF inhibitors), but over time loses the therapeutic benefit and the disease symptoms return or worsen despite continued treatment. This contrasts with primary nonresponse, where the patient does not respond to treatment from the outset. Secondary nonresponse may be due to factors like the development of anti-drug antibodies, changes in disease activity, or other pharmacodynamic reasons."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "8. What is the recommendation regarding continuous versus on-demand NSAID use for axial SpA?",
        "respuesta": "The recommendation for axial spondyloarthritis (axial SpA) generally favors using nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on an on-demand basis rather than continuous use. Continuous NSAID use may be considered in patients with persistently high disease activity and significant symptoms, but routine continuous use is not universally recommended due to potential long-term side effects. Treatment should be individualized based on symptom severity and patient tolerance."

    {
        "pregunta": "9. What are the preferred treatments for patients with AS who have contraindications to TNF inhibitors due to congestive heart failure or demyelinating disease?",
        "respuesta": "For patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) who have contraindications to TNF inhibitors due to congestive heart failure or demyelinating disease, preferred treatment options include the use of interleukin-17 (IL-17) inhibitors such as secukinumab or ixekizumab. These agents have demonstrated efficacy in AS and have a different safety profile that makes them suitable alternatives when TNF inhibitors are contraindicated. Additionally, conventional treatments like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy remain important components of management."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "10. Why might clinical assessment alone be insufficient to evaluate disease activity in axial SpA?",
        "respuesta": "Clinical assessment alone may be insufficient to evaluate disease activity in axial spondyloarthritis (axial SpA) because symptoms such as pain and stiffness are subjective and can be influenced by factors unrelated to inflammation, such as mechanical pain or psychological factors. Additionally, clinical examination may not detect subclinical inflammation or structural changes. Therefore, imaging (e.g., MRI) and biomarkers (e.g., CRP) are often necessary to accurately assess inflammation and disease activity."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "11. What is the recommendation on discontinuing biologic therapy in patients with stable axial SpA?",
        "respuesta": "The recommendation is generally to continue biologic therapy in patients with stable axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) to maintain disease control, as discontinuation often leads to relapse. If discontinuation is considered, it should be done cautiously with close monitoring, and patients should be informed about the risk of flare. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to routinely recommend stopping biologic therapy in stable axial SpA."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "12. List the TNF inhibitors (TNFi) recommended for treatment of axial spondyloarthritis.",
        "respuesta": "The TNF inhibitors (TNFi) recommended for the treatment of axial spondyloarthritis include:\n\n1. **Etanercept**  \n2. **Infliximab**  \n3. **Adalimumab**  \n4. **Golimumab**  \n5. **Certolizumab pegol**\n\nThese biologics are effective in reducing inflammation and improving symptoms in patients with axial spondyloarthritis."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "13. Is adding sulfasalazine or methotrexate recommended in AS patients who do not respond adequately to TNF inhibitors?",
        "respuesta": "Adding sulfasalazine or methotrexate is generally not recommended in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients who do not respond adequately to TNF inhibitors, as these conventional DMARDs have limited efficacy in axial symptoms of AS. Their use may be considered only if peripheral arthritis is present. For inadequate TNF inhibitor response, switching to another biologic or targeted therapy is preferred."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "14. What is the strength of recommendation for using NSAIDs in the treatment of adults with nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (SpA)?",
        "respuesta": "The strength of recommendation for using NSAIDs in the treatment of adults with nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) is generally strong. NSAIDs are considered first-line therapy due to their effectiveness in reducing pain and inflammation. Clinical guidelines typically give a strong recommendation for their use in managing symptoms of nonradiographic axial SpA."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "15. What is the role of locally administered parenteral glucocorticoids in axial SpA management?",
        "respuesta": "Locally administered parenteral glucocorticoids (such as intra-articular or periarticular injections) have a limited role in axial spondyloarthritis (axial SpA) management. They may be used to provide short-term relief of inflammation and pain in peripheral joints or entheses but are generally not effective for axial symptoms involving the spine or sacroiliac joints. Systemic treatments, including NSAIDs and biologic agents, remain the mainstay for axial disease control."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "16. How should shared decision-making be integrated into the treatment approach for axial spondyloarthritis?",
        "respuesta": "Shared decision-making in the treatment of axial spondyloarthritis involves actively engaging the patient in discussions about their diagnosis, treatment options, benefits, risks, and potential outcomes. Clinicians should provide clear, evidence-based information tailored to the patient’s values, preferences, and lifestyle. This collaborative approach helps ensure that treatment plans—such as the use of NSAIDs, biologics, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications—align with the patient’s goals, improving adherence and overall satisfaction with care. Regular reassessment and open communication are essential to adjust treatment as needed."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "17. For patients with contraindications to TNFi, what biologic treatments are conditionally recommended?",
        "respuesta": "For patients with contraindications to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), biologic treatments that are conditionally recommended include interleukin-17 inhibitors (such as secukinumab or ixekizumab) and interleukin-12/23 inhibitors (such as ustekinumab). These alternatives are often considered based on individual patient factors and disease characteristics."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "18. What is the conditional recommendation for using tofacitinib in active AS compared to TNF inhibitors or IL-17 inhibitors?",
        "respuesta": "The conditional recommendation for using tofacitinib in active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is that it may be considered for patients who have an inadequate response or intolerance to TNF inhibitors or IL-17 inhibitors. However, TNF inhibitors and IL-17 inhibitors remain the preferred first-line biologic treatments due to more extensive evidence supporting their efficacy and safety."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "19. What does the guideline recommend about participation in formal group or individual self-management education for axial spondyloarthritis patients?",
        "respuesta": "The guideline recommends that patients with axial spondyloarthritis participate in formal group or individual self-management education to improve their understanding of the disease, enhance coping strategies, and support adherence to treatment and lifestyle modifications."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "20. Is there a preferred TNF inhibitor recommended for treatment of active AS after NSAID failure?",
        "respuesta": "There is no single preferred TNF inhibitor recommended for the treatment of active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) after NSAID failure. Several TNF inhibitors—including etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, and golimumab—have demonstrated efficacy and are approved options. The choice depends on patient-specific factors, including comorbidities, route of administration preferences, and safety profiles."
