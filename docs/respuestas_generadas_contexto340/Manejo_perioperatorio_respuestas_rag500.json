        "respuesta": "Balancing the risk of infection versus the risk of disease flare when managing immunosuppressive therapy during the perioperative period is important because:\n\n- Patients with inflammatory arthritis (IA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) are at increased risk of infection after total hip or knee arthroplasty (THA or TKA), and immunosuppressive therapy is a modifiable risk factor for perioperative infection.\n\n- Conversely, withholding immunosuppressive medications increases the risk of disease flares, which can adversely impact quality of life. In particular, patients with severe SLE are at high risk of organ damage if flares occur.\n\n- Postoperative adverse events (e.g., infections) are more closely linked to underlying disease severity than to medication exposure alone.\n\n- Therefore, continuing immunosuppressive therapy perioperatively may be necessary in severe SLE to prevent flares and organ damage, while withholding or timing interruption of certain medications (like JAK inhibitors or biologics) may reduce infection risk.\n\n- The guidelines reflect this balance by issuing conditional recommendations that consider both risks and emphasize individualized clinical assessment and shared decision-making.\n\nIn summary, careful balancing aims to minimize infection risk without triggering disease flares, optimizing outcomes during the vulnerable perioperative period.",

As patients with IA and SLE are at increased risk of infection after THA and TKA, these recommendations aim to balance the risk of perioperative infection and the risk of disease flares, recognizing that all flares have an impact on quality of life but a flare in a patient with severe SLE at risk for organ damage warrants unique considerations.

        "respuesta": "The guideline relies largely on indirect or low-quality evidence for its recommendations on perioperative medication management because:\n\n- There is a paucity of high-quality, direct evidence specifically addressing the risks and benefits of immunosuppressive medication use in the context of total hip or knee arthroplasty (THA or TKA) in patients with rheumatic diseases.\n\n- Most available data come from small-scale observational studies, indirect studies of populations without rheumatic diseases, or nonsurgical settings that do not fully represent the targeted patient group or perioperative context.\n\n- Conducting moderate- or high-quality randomized controlled trials in this area is challenging due to ethical and practical considerations.\n\n- Consequently, the guideline must rely on assumptions and conclusions extrapolated from these indirect sources, leading to conditional recommendations supported by low or very low certainty evidence.\n\nThis limitation is explicitly acknowledged and is the major constraint affecting the strength and quality of the guideline’s recommendations.",
