Secukinumab and ixekizumab are not recommended in patients with IBD or recurrent uveitis, as TNFi monoclonal antibodies are better options. Tofacitinib is a potential second-line option for patients with contraindications to TNFi other than infections. Recommendations regarding tofacitinib may change pending the results of larger clinical trials. Several of the 2015 recommendations were modified in this update. The current recommendation is conditionally in favor of use of sulfasalazine in limited clinical circumstances, whereas the 2015 recommendations had this as an exception to the general recommendation against the use of conventional synthetic antirheumatic drugs. In the 2015 recommendations, sulfasalazine and pamidronate were suggested as alternatives for the treatment of patients with active disease and contraindications to TNFi,",

We did not reexamine all of the 2015 recommendations, but rather focused on those questions for which consequential new evidence was present. We added several new recommendations on how the newly available medications should fit in treatment strategies and on the use of imaging. The target populations are adults with AS or nonradiographic axial SpA. The target users of these recommendations are rheumatologists, primary care clinicians, physiatrists, physical therapists, and others providing care to patients with axial SpA.

Several major themes emerged from their participation. Patients/caregivers stressed the need for individualizing treatments because what works for one does not work for all . To facilitate individualization, no rigid time frames were required for an advancement of treatment. Moving quickly may be needed for a patient whose condition is rapidly worsening, while moving more slowly may be appropriate for one whose condition has improved substantially but not fully.

In cases of failure of TNFi, the 2015 guidelines included a conditional recommendation for a trial of a second TNFi and against use of a non-TNFi biologic, whereas the current guidelines differentiate treatment recommendations based on whether there was primary or secondary nonresponse to the TNFi. For the treatment of patients with recurrent uveitis, the previous guidelines specified conditional use of infliximab or adalimumab, while the update broadened this recommendation to include TNFi monoclonal antibodies generally. Similarly, for patients with coexisting IBD, the update includes a conditional recommendation for TNFi monoclonal antibodies over other biologics, rather than over only etanercept.",

Finally, the recommendation for use of TNFi in patients with active nonradiographic axial SpA was changed from conditional to strong. New questions on the treatment of patients with stable disease were addressed in this update. Discontinuation of biologics is not recommended due to the likelihood for symptom recurrence. If tapering is considered, patients should be counseled regarding the potential for increased disease activity. Co-treatment with low-dose methotrexate is not generally recommended, but ongoing studies will shed further light on this question. Switching to a biosimilar during the course of treatment with TNFi is also not recommended, echoing the concerns previously expressed by the ACR Imaging remains a central tool in the diagnosis of axial SpA, but its role in monitoring patients is less well-defined.

Providers and patients have questions on where these new medications fit in the pharmacologic strategy, and how originator TNFi, sulfasalazine, and NSAIDs should be used given these new options. Based on the current evidence and the considerations of the panel, NSAIDs and TNFi remain the primary classes of medications for the treatment of AS and nonradiographic axial SpA.
