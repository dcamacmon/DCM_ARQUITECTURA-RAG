Because the guidance on frequency was based on expert opinion and patient preferences rather than evidence, we aimed for uniformity in our recommendations across diseases to ease implementation. We recognize that the frequency of monitoring will vary based on individual disease presentation and shared decision-making with each patient. It was challenging for this group to reach consensus on the recommendation for ambulatory oxygen desaturation testing and the frequency of this testing.

More frequent monitoring, based on physician judgment, should be performed in patients with symptom worsening, a UIP pattern, presence of autoantibodies associated with rapidly progressive disease (eg, anti-MDA-5), and worsening PFTs. People with MCTD and prominent features of SSc or IIM may benefit from more frequent monitoring.
