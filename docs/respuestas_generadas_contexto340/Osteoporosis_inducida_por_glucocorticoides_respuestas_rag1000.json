INTRODUCTION Glucocorticoids (GCs) remain a common therapeutic modality for patients with a variety of diseases. Prevention of GC-induced bone loss and fractures has been a focus of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) for many years because patients with osteoporotic fractures have increased risk of morbidity and mortality Despite increasing treatment options to prevent and treat glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP), many GC-treated patients are not evaluated or treated, resulting in preventable fractures The ACR first published recommendations for prevention and treatment of GIOP in 1996 METHODS This guideline follows the ACR guideline development process and ACR policy guiding management of conflicts of interest",

On a basis of consensus and in accordance with the overarching principles, the group unanimously agreed to choose the minimum effective individualized duration and dose of GCs to balance benefit versus harm after assessing risk factors for GC-related adverse events, comorbidities, concomitant medications, relapses and prolonged therapy. Our recommended GC tapering schedule (see Recommendation 4) assumes a minimum of 12 months of treatment. A more specific statement is not possible because of the lack of PMR studies on this particular topic and because of the multiple subgroups and factors that need to be taken into account. Recommendation 3: (PICOs 3-5) The panel conditionally recommends using the minimum effective GC dose within a range of 12.5-25 mg prednisone equivalent daily as the initial treatment of PMR. A higher initial prednisone dose within this range may be considered in patients with a high risk of relapse and low risk of adverse events, whereas in",

Recommendations are intended to be used by all clinicians caring for persons with JIA and assume that patients do not have contraindications to the recommended pharmacologic treatments. 4. Longer-term glucocorticoid therapy in childhood is not appropriate because of its effects on bone health and growth. Thus, wherever glucocorticoids are suggested, recommended treatment should be limited to the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. 5.

Other agents including intravenous BPs, PTH/PTHrP, and denosumab (DEN) are also options and are conditionally recommended given lack of fracture prevention data in GIOP populations.

For adults ≥40 years with high fracture risk, we conditionally recommend PTH/PTHrP or DEN over BP (PICO 1.4c-1.28.c). For adults ≥40 years with high fracture risk, we conditionally recommend IV or oral BP, PTH/PTHrP, or DEN over Raloxifene (RAL) or Romosozumab (ROM) (PICO 1.4c-1.28.c). High-certainty evidence indicates that oral BP prevents vertebral fractures in GIOP Compared to BP and RAL, PTH/PTHrP, DEN, and ROM require sequential therapy with an anti-resorptive agent to prevent bone losses. Discontinuation of DEN must be followed by a BP beginning at 6 to 7 months after the last DEN dose to prevent rapidly progressive vertebral fractures. Additionally, IV",

These strong recommendations are based on good clinical practice and the need for clinicians to risk stratify patients beginning or continuing GC therapy, despite the low certainty of the evidence. Initial assessment should occur as soon as possible within 6 months of GC therapy initiation. Clinical fracture risk assessment includes dose, duration, and pattern of GC use, alcohol use, smoking history, hypogonadism, history of prior fractures (traumatic, fragility, asymptomatic), low body weight, significant weight loss, parental history of hip fracture, fall history, thyroid disease, hyperparathyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, malabsorption, chronic liver disease, and inflammatory bowel disease (Figure 1 1",

For adults at very high risk, we conditionally recommended PTH/PTHrP over antiresorptives We strongly recommend oral BP over no treatment in high and very high fracture risk due to fracture reduction in GIOP. We conditionally recommend PTH/PTHrP over anti-resorptives in patients at very high risk of fracture. We conditionally recommend DEN $& or",

Multiple studies have shown that 12 months of ROM followed by an anti-resorptive agent (BP or DEN) for 12 month prevents fractures in patients with postmenopausal OP when compared to antiresorptive agent only In adults with low fracture risk, we strongly recommend against adding oral or IV BP, PTH/PTHrP, RAL, DEN, or ROM (PICO 1.4a-1.28a). Adults <40 years have low fracture risk and have significant capacity to rebuild BMD losses induced by chronic GC therapy. OP therapy should not be started in this low-risk group Recommendations for special populations of patients beginning long-term GC therapy at very high risk for fracture (Table 2 For adults ≥40 years at very high fracture risk due to treatment with one or more courses of high-dose GC therapy (mean dose prednisone equivalent ≥30 mg daily for ≥30 days)",
            "investigate include the following: 1) biomarker studies to identify more specific, reliable indicators of disease activity that can guide treatment decisions; 2) trials to clarify how best to use the currently available medications (e.g., dosing, duration, effective combinations, and in which population to use which drugs); 3) trials to identify novel, targeted, and/or glucocorticoid-sparing agents with minimal toxicity; and 4) long-term studies to understand the course of disease and the safety of current therapies. We hope significant progress will be made in these areas such that future recommendations provide a more tailored approach to disease management, minimize treatment toxicity, and prevent organ damage in these patients.

            "this update, tapering recommendations are made for patients who are in low disease activity or remission in the face of a paucity of data about when and how best to taper. The panel recommended that careful tapering might be considered if the patient wishes to cut back on their use of DMARDs. However, patients should be closely evaluated during any taper, and if a flare occurs, the prior regimen should be reinstituted promptly. Last, this update includes several recommendations against the use of glucocorticoid therapy. These recommendations were made in recognition of the frequent difficulty tapering glucocorticoids leading to undesirable prolonged use and the increasing evidence of the negative impact of glucocorticoids on long-term patient outcomes, including risk for infection, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease, in RA and other rheumatic diseases While consensus was easily reached on the majority of statements, 2 issues required prolonged discussion and debate.
