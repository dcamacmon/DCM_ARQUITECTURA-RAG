Conditional recommendations—where evidence is low quality or benefits and harms are uncertain—highlight the importance of incorporating patient preferences, values, and individual circumstances into therapeutic decisions. This approach helps choose the safest and most effective treatments personalized for each patient.\n\nSpecifically, shared decision-making should be applied when considering options such as biologic therapy initiation, tapering, or switching; NSAID use (continuous versus on-demand); use of newer agents like tofacitinib; and locally administered glucocorticoids. Given the variability in response, potential side effects, and impact on comorbidities, collaborative discussions between clinicians and patients optimize outcomes in axial SpA management.\n\nIn summary, shared decision-making is integral to axial SpA treatment, particularly when recommendations are conditional or evidence is uncertain, and helps align treatment plans with patient goals and risks.",
