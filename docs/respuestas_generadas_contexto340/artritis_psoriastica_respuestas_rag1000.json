        "respuesta": "When many recommendations are conditional, treatment decisions should be approached through a shared decision-making process that incorporates the patient’s values, preferences, and unique clinical circumstances. Conditional recommendations indicate uncertainty or a close balance between benefits and harms, often due to lower-quality evidence or sensitivity to individual patient factors. Therefore, these recommendations apply to most patients but allow reasonable alternatives based on individual considerations, including patient preferences and cost impacts. Clinicians and patients should engage in individualized discussions to tailor treatment choices rather than applying rigid, one-size-fits-all approaches.",

A conditional recommendation means that the panel believed the desirable effects of following the recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, so the course of action would apply to the majority of the patients, but a small proportion of clinicians/patients may not want to follow the recommendation. Because of this, conditional recommendations are preference sensitive and always warrant a shared decision-making approach. We use the phrase \"is recommended over\" or \"is/would be recommended\" for conditional recommendations.

Nail lesions, including pitting and onycholysis, occur in ~80-90% of patients with PsA. The incidence of PsA is ~6 per 100,000 per year, and the prevalence is ~1-2 per 1,000 in the general population PsA affects men and women equally. The distribution of the peripheral arthritis varies from asymmetric oligoarthritis (involving ≤4 joints) to symmetric polyarthritis (involving ≥5 joints). Distal interphalangeal joints are commonly affected and, in some patients, are the only affected joints. Axial disease, when present, usually occurs together with peripheral arthritis.
