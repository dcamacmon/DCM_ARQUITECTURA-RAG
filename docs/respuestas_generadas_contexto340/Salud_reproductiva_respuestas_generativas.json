        "pregunta": "1. Why can pregnancy-induced hypertension syndromes be confused with active RMD flares?",
        "respuesta": "Pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) syndromes, such as preeclampsia, can be confused with active rheumatic musculoskeletal disease (RMD) flares because both conditions share overlapping clinical features, including hypertension, proteinuria, edema, and elevated inflammatory markers. Additionally, symptoms like joint pain, fatigue, and organ involvement may be present in both, making it challenging to distinguish between a PIH syndrome and an RMD flare without careful evaluation of disease history, timing, and specific laboratory tests."

        "pregunta": "2. What is the rationale behind conditionally recommending continuation of methotrexate (MTX) in men planning to father a pregnancy?",
        "respuesta": "The rationale behind conditionally recommending continuation of methotrexate (MTX) in men planning to father a pregnancy is based on evidence suggesting that MTX has low risk of causing significant harm to sperm or increasing the risk of congenital abnormalities. While MTX is teratogenic when taken by women during pregnancy, its impact via paternal exposure appears minimal. Therefore, the benefits of continuing MTX for disease control in men may outweigh potential, but unproven, reproductive risks. This conditional recommendation balances maintaining disease stability with the low likelihood of adverse effects on fertility or offspring."

        "pregunta": "3. What are the risks and benefits of using prednisone in pregnant women with APS who fail standard therapy?",
        "respuesta": "Prednisone, a corticosteroid, may be used in pregnant women with antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) who fail standard therapy (usually low-dose aspirin and heparin). \n\n**Benefits:**\n- Prednisone can help suppress inflammation and modulate the immune response, potentially reducing the risk of pregnancy complications such as recurrent miscarriage, fetal growth restriction, and preeclampsia associated with APS.\n- It may improve pregnancy outcomes in refractory cases where standard therapy is insufficient.\n\n**Risks:**\n- Maternal side effects include increased risk of hypertension, gestational diabetes, infection, and osteoporosis.\n- Potential fetal risks include low birth weight, cleft palate (rare), and possible effects on fetal growth.\n- Long-term or high-dose use is generally avoided due to these risks.\n\nIn summary, prednisone may be considered as adjunct therapy in pregnant women with APS who do not respond to standard treatment, but its use requires careful risk-benefit assessment and close monitoring by specialists."

        "pregunta": "4. What is the recommended approach to emergency contraception in women with RMD, including those with SLE or positive aPL?",
        "respuesta": "In women with rheumatic musculoskeletal diseases (RMD), including those with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or positive antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL), emergency contraception is generally considered safe and should be offered when needed. The recommended approach is to use non-estrogen methods whenever possible, such as the copper intrauterine device (IUD), which is highly effective and does not increase thrombotic risk. If hormonal emergency contraception is used, progestin-only options (like levonorgestrel) are preferred over combined estrogen-progestin pills, particularly in patients with high thrombotic risk (e.g., those with active SLE or positive aPL). Consultation with a rheumatologist or specialist may be warranted for individualized assessment."

        "pregunta": "5. Why is depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) generally avoided in patients at risk for osteoporosis with rheumatic diseases?",
        "respuesta": "Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) is generally avoided in patients at risk for osteoporosis with rheumatic diseases because it can cause a decrease in bone mineral density. DMPA suppresses estrogen production, leading to hypoestrogenism, which negatively affects bone health and increases the risk of osteoporosis and fractures. Since patients with rheumatic diseases may already have an elevated risk for osteoporosis due to inflammation, corticosteroid use, and reduced mobility, using DMPA can further exacerbate bone loss."

        "pregunta": "6. What is the rationale for recommending the use of two contraceptive methods together or an IUD alone in women with RMD taking mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)?",
        "respuesta": "The rationale for recommending the use of two contraceptive methods together or an intrauterine device (IUD) alone in women with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) taking mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is to ensure highly effective contraception due to the high risk of teratogenicity associated with MMF. MMF is known to cause severe congenital malformations and pregnancy loss, so preventing pregnancy is critical. Using two contraceptive methods (such as a hormonal method plus a barrier method) or a highly reliable method like an IUD alone minimizes the risk of unintended pregnancy, thereby protecting against MMF-related fetal harm."

        "pregunta": "7. What is the recommended management of rituximab treatment in pregnant patients with severe, life- or organ-threatening rheumatic disease?",
        "respuesta": "The recommended management of rituximab treatment in pregnant patients with severe, life- or organ-threatening rheumatic disease is to use rituximab only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. Rituximab is generally avoided during pregnancy due to limited safety data and potential risks such as fetal B-cell depletion. If treatment is necessary, it is typically recommended to administer rituximab before conception or during the first trimester, with careful monitoring throughout pregnancy. Multidisciplinary management involving rheumatologists, obstetricians, and pediatricians is essential to optimize maternal and fetal outcomes."

        "pregunta": "8. How does fetal echocardiography monitoring change for women with a prior infant affected by NLE or CHB?",
        "respuesta": "For women with a prior infant affected by neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE) or congenital heart block (CHB), fetal echocardiography monitoring is intensified and typically begins earlier in pregnancy, often starting around 16 weeks gestation. Serial echocardiograms are performed weekly or biweekly from 16 to 26 weeks to closely monitor the fetal heart for early signs of heart block or cardiac involvement. This enhanced surveillance aims to detect conduction abnormalities promptly to allow for early intervention and management."

        "pregunta": "9. What is the recommendation regarding the use of prophylactic prednisone in patients undergoing assisted reproductive technology with active SLE?",
        "respuesta": "The use of prophylactic prednisone in patients with active systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) is generally not routinely recommended due to the potential risks of corticosteroid side effects. However, low-dose prednisone may be considered in selected cases to control disease activity or prevent lupus flares during ART, especially if the disease is active. Treatment decisions should be individualized, balancing the benefits of controlling SLE activity with the risks of corticosteroids, and made in consultation with a rheumatologist and reproductive specialist."

        "pregunta": "10. Under what circumstances is stress-dose glucocorticoid administration recommended during delivery in patients with rheumatic diseases?",
        "respuesta": "Stress-dose glucocorticoid administration during delivery is recommended in patients with rheumatic diseases who are on long-term glucocorticoid therapy, typically equivalent to prednisone â‰¥5 mg/day for more than 3 weeks, or who have recently discontinued glucocorticoids. This is to prevent adrenal insufficiency due to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis suppression during the physiological stress of labor and delivery."

        "pregunta": "11. Why might aspirin be withheld prior to oocyte retrieval in patients undergoing ART?",
        "respuesta": "Aspirin might be withheld prior to oocyte retrieval in patients undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART) because it can increase the risk of bleeding during the procedure. Since aspirin inhibits platelet function and prolongs bleeding time, discontinuing it helps minimize the risk of hemorrhage and related complications during the invasive oocyte retrieval process."

        "pregunta": "12. What contraceptive methods are recommended for women with RMD receiving mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)?",
        "respuesta": "For women with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) receiving mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), effective contraception is crucial due to the high risk of teratogenicity associated with MMF. Recommended contraceptive methods include highly effective options such as:\n\n- Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) like intrauterine devices (IUDs) and subdermal implants\n- Combined hormonal contraceptives (oral, patch, or vaginal ring), if not contraindicated\n- Progestin-only methods if estrogen is contraindicated\n- Consistent and correct use of barrier methods (e.g., condoms) in combination with other methods\n\nDual contraception (using two methods concurrently) is often advised to minimize the risk of unintended pregnancy. Contraceptive counseling should be part of routine care for women on MMF."

        "pregunta": "13. What ovarian stimulation protocol adjustments may reduce thrombosis risk in women with RMD undergoing ART?",
        "respuesta": "To reduce thrombosis risk in women with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART), ovarian stimulation protocols can be adjusted by:\n\n1. Using a mild or minimal stimulation protocol to reduce the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), which is associated with increased thrombotic risk.\n2. Employing GnRH antagonist protocols rather than long GnRH agonist protocols, as they allow for safer triggering options.\n3. Triggering final oocyte maturation with a GnRH agonist instead of hCG to lower OHSS and thrombosis risk.\n4. Careful monitoring and individualized dosing to avoid excessive ovarian response.\n5. Considering prophylactic anticoagulation in high-risk patients as per clinical guidelines.\n\nThese adjustments aim to minimize hypercoagulability associated with ART in women predisposed to thrombosis due to RMD."

        "pregunta": "14. How should patients with a history of neonatal lupus and positive anti-Ro/SSA antibodies be monitored during pregnancy?",
        "respuesta": "Patients with a history of neonatal lupus and positive anti-Ro/SSA antibodies should be closely monitored during pregnancy because of the risk of fetal cardiac involvement, particularly congenital heart block. Monitoring typically includes:\n\n- Serial fetal echocardiography (usually weekly) from 16 to 26 weeks gestation to detect early signs of heart block or other cardiac abnormalities.\n- Regular obstetric ultrasounds to assess fetal well-being.\n- Maternal clinical monitoring for autoimmune disease activity.\n\nEarly detection through frequent fetal echocardiograms allows timely intervention, such as administration of fluorinated steroids if heart block is detected. Coordination with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and a pediatric cardiologist is recommended."

        "pregunta": "15. What are the recommendations regarding the use of combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and moderate to high disease activity?",
        "respuesta": "In patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who have moderate to high disease activity, combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives are generally not recommended. This is due to the increased risk of disease flare and thromboembolic events associated with estrogen-containing contraceptives in this population. Alternative contraceptive methods, such as progestin-only contraceptives or non-hormonal options, are preferred to minimize these risks."

        "pregunta": "16. What is the recommended approach to discuss medication use in patients with RMD who are planning pregnancy?",
        "respuesta": "The recommended approach to discuss medication use in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) planning pregnancy is to have a planned, multidisciplinary preconception consultation. This should involve rheumatologists, obstetricians, and possibly pharmacists to review current medications, assess disease activity, and adjust treatment to use the safest options compatible with pregnancy. The goal is to minimize disease flares while avoiding teratogenic drugs, ensuring both maternal health and fetal safety. Early counseling allows for optimal timing of pregnancy and medication adjustments."

        "pregunta": "17. How might mycophenolate-containing medications affect the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives in women with RMD?",
        "respuesta": "Mycophenolate-containing medications can reduce the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives in women with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) due to potential drug interactions that may alter hormone metabolism. Additionally, mycophenolate is teratogenic, so effective contraception is strongly recommended. Women taking mycophenolate should use reliable, often non-hormonal or dual-method contraception to prevent pregnancy."

        "pregunta": "18. What contraceptive method is strongly recommended for women with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, and why?",
        "respuesta": "For women with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, **intrauterine devices (IUDs), particularly hormonal IUDs, are strongly recommended** as a contraceptive method. This recommendation is due to their high efficacy, long-acting nature, and safety profile, including minimal systemic hormone exposure, which is beneficial given potential drug interactions and the immunosuppressed state. Additionally, IUDs do not increase the risk of thromboembolism, which is a concern with estrogen-containing contraceptives in this patient population."

    {
        "pregunta": "19. What anticoagulation regimen is typically used prophylactically during ovarian stimulation in asymptomatic aPL-positive patients?",
        "respuesta": "In asymptomatic antiphospholipid antibody (aPL)-positive patients undergoing ovarian stimulation, prophylactic anticoagulation typically involves low-dose aspirin alone or in combination with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). The exact regimen may vary based on individual risk factors, but low-dose aspirin (e.g., 81 mg daily) is commonly initiated prior to stimulation, and LMWH may be added especially if additional risk factors for thrombosis are present."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "20. Why is repeated testing for anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies during pregnancy generally not recommended?",
        "respuesta": "Repeated testing for anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies during pregnancy is generally not recommended because these autoantibodies, once present, typically remain stable throughout pregnancy. Their levels do not fluctuate significantly to warrant repeated measurements, and a single positive test early in pregnancy is sufficient to assess the risk of neonatal lupus and congenital heart block. Therefore, repeated testing does not provide additional clinical benefit and may lead to unnecessary anxiety or interventions."
