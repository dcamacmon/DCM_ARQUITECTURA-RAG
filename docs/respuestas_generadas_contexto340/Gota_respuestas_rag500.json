Treatment adjustments should be guided primarily by:\n\n- **Disease activity:** Frequent gout flares (≥2 per year) or presence of nonresolving tophi indicate active disease requiring more aggressive therapy or treatment escalation. Conversely, infrequent flares (<2 per year) and absence of tophi may support conservative adjustment or continuation of current therapy.\n\n- **Treatment efficacy:** If SU targets are not met despite optimized therapy (e.g., maximally titrated allopurinol or other agents), clinicians should consider switching or adding alternative therapies. For example, switching to pegloticase is strongly recommended for patients with frequent flares or tophi who have failed multiple ULT options, while it is strongly recommended against in patients with infrequent flares and no tophi.\n\n- **Potential harms:** Initiating or increasing ULT should start at low doses (e.g., allopurinol ≤100 mg/day) with gradual titration to reduce the risk of flares and adverse effects. Patient-specific factors such as comorbidities and drug tolerability should inform agent selection and dosing.\n\n- **Shared decision-making:** Given uncertainties in evidence quality, particularly regarding lifestyle modifications and certain drug options, patient preferences and values should be integrated into treatment planning.\n\nIn summary, clinicians should individualize gout management by monitoring disease activity and SU levels, carefully adjusting ULT while minimizing risks, and involving patients in decisions to optimize long-term outcomes.",
