        "pregunta": "1. How does the quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, very low) impact vaccination recommendations in patients with RMD?",
        "respuesta": "The quality of evidence significantly impacts vaccination recommendations in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD). High-quality evidence provides strong confidence in the benefits and safety of vaccines, leading to firm recommendations for vaccination in these patients. Moderate-quality evidence may result in conditional or cautious recommendations, emphasizing the need for individualized decision-making. Low or very low-quality evidence often leads to more tentative guidance, highlighting uncertainties regarding vaccine efficacy or safety, and may prompt clinicians to weigh risks and benefits carefully or recommend vaccination only in specific circumstances. Overall, higher-quality evidence supports clearer and more definitive vaccination guidelines for patients with RMD."

        "pregunta": "2. How should immunosuppressive medications other than methotrexate and rituximab be managed around the time of non-live attenuated vaccine administration?",
        "respuesta": "For immunosuppressive medications other than methotrexate and rituximab, the general recommendation is often to continue these medications without interruption when administering non-live attenuated vaccines. This is because stopping immunosuppressive therapy may risk disease flare, and non-live vaccines are generally safe and can still provide benefit even if the immune response might be somewhat reduced. However, specific management can vary depending on the medication, the patient's condition, and the vaccine type, so individual clinical judgment and current guidelines should be consulted."

        "pregunta": "3. What is the rationale for holding IVIG prior to vaccination?",
        "respuesta": "The rationale for holding intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) prior to vaccination is to avoid interference with the immune response to the vaccine. IVIG contains pooled antibodies that can neutralize live attenuated vaccine viruses or antigens, potentially reducing the vaccine’s effectiveness. Therefore, delaying IVIG administration around the time of vaccination helps ensure optimal vaccine-induced immunity."

    {
        "pregunta": "4. What is the evidence quality regarding holding immunosuppressive medications to improve vaccine response?",
        "respuesta": "The evidence quality regarding holding immunosuppressive medications to improve vaccine response is generally low to moderate. While some studies suggest that temporarily pausing certain immunosuppressive drugs around the time of vaccination can enhance immune responses, the data are limited, vary by medication type, and often come from small or observational studies. Clinical guidelines may recommend holding specific agents in select cases, but more high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed to provide definitive evidence."

        "pregunta": "8. Under what circumstances should seasonal influenza vaccination be administered to RMD patients, even if disease activity is high or patients are on high-dose glucocorticoids or rituximab?",
        "respuesta": "Seasonal influenza vaccination should be administered to patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) even if disease activity is high or they are on high-dose glucocorticoids or rituximab because these patients are at increased risk of severe influenza and its complications. The benefits of vaccination in preventing influenza generally outweigh the potential risk of transient disease flare or reduced vaccine efficacy. Vaccination is recommended unless there are specific contraindications, as it provides important protection in this vulnerable population."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "9. Why might non-rheumatology providers be encouraged to administer influenza vaccination even if methotrexate is not held immediately?",
        "respuesta": "Non-rheumatology providers might be encouraged to administer influenza vaccination without holding methotrexate immediately because timely vaccination is crucial to provide protection against influenza, especially in immunocompromised patients. Delaying vaccination to adjust methotrexate dosing could result in missed or late immunization, reducing overall vaccine coverage and increasing the risk of influenza infection. Therefore, the benefits of prompt vaccination often outweigh the potential modest impact of methotrexate on vaccine response."

    {
        "pregunta": "14. In what way can intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy impact the efficacy of live attenuated vaccines?",
        "respuesta": "Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy can reduce the efficacy of live attenuated vaccines by providing passive antibodies that neutralize the vaccine virus, preventing replication and subsequent immune response. As a result, vaccination with live attenuated vaccines is generally delayed for several months after IVIG administration to ensure effective immunization."

    {
        "pregunta": "15. What role do bDMARDs (biologic DMARDs) play in modifying vaccine response or safety profiles?",
        "respuesta": "Biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs) can influence vaccine responses and safety profiles by modulating the immune system. They may reduce the effectiveness of certain vaccines, particularly live-attenuated vaccines, due to immunosuppression, potentially leading to a diminished antibody response. However, inactivated vaccines are generally considered safe and can still provide protective immunity, although the response might be attenuated. Careful timing of vaccination relative to bDMARD therapy and consultation with healthcare providers is recommended to optimize vaccine efficacy and safety."

    {
        "pregunta": "16. Why is a 4-week hold period recommended before vaccination for patients on slow-acting conventional DMARDs?",
        "respuesta": "A 4-week hold period before vaccination is recommended for patients on slow-acting conventional DMARDs to allow the immune system to recover sufficiently for an effective vaccine response. These drugs can suppress immune function, potentially reducing vaccine efficacy. Pausing DMARDs helps optimize the immune response to the vaccine, improving its effectiveness and ensuring better protection."

    {
        "pregunta": "20. What are the key differences between live attenuated and non-live vaccines regarding their use in immunocompromised patients?",
        "respuesta": "Live attenuated vaccines contain weakened but replication-competent pathogens that can stimulate strong and long-lasting immune responses. However, because the organisms are live, there is a risk they could cause disease in immunocompromised patients, whose immune systems may not control even the weakened pathogen effectively. Therefore, live attenuated vaccines are generally contraindicated or used with caution in immunocompromised individuals.\n\nNon-live (inactivated or subunit) vaccines contain killed pathogens or components that cannot replicate. They are safer for immunocompromised patients because they cannot cause infection, though they may elicit a weaker or less durable immune response compared to live vaccines. Non-live vaccines are typically preferred for immunocompromised individuals."
