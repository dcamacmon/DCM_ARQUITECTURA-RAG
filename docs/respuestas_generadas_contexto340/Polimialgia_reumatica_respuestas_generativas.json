        "pregunta": "2. How should glucocorticoid doses be tapered in PMR patients, according to current clinical practice recommendations?",
        "respuesta": "In patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), glucocorticoid doses should be tapered gradually to minimize relapse risk and adverse effects. Current clinical practice recommends starting with a moderate dose of prednisone (typically 12.5–25 mg daily), followed by a slow taper after symptom control is achieved, usually over several months. The dose is often reduced by about 2.5 mg every 2–4 weeks initially, then more slowly (e.g., by 1 mg every 1–2 months) as the dose gets lower, aiming to discontinue glucocorticoids over 12 to 18 months. The tapering schedule should be individualized based on clinical response and relapse risk, with close monitoring for symptoms."

    {
        "pregunta": "3. How should patients with long-standing PMR on low-dose glucocorticoids be managed according to the guideline?",
        "respuesta": "According to guidelines, patients with long-standing polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) on low-dose glucocorticoids should be regularly assessed for disease activity and glucocorticoid side effects. Gradual tapering of glucocorticoids is recommended to minimize exposure while monitoring for relapse. Adjunctive therapies such as methotrexate may be considered to help reduce glucocorticoid dose. Bone protection and management of comorbidities should also be addressed. If disease remission is sustained, cautious discontinuation of glucocorticoids may be attempted under close supervision."

    {
        "pregunta": "7. How do cost implications factor into the current PMR treatment recommendations?",
        "respuesta": "Cost implications play a significant role in current polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) treatment recommendations by influencing the choice and duration of therapy. While glucocorticoids remain the mainstay of treatment due to their effectiveness and relatively low cost, their long-term use can lead to expensive management of side effects. Therefore, treatment guidelines emphasize using the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible duration to minimize both clinical risks and financial burden. Additionally, the cost of adjunctive therapies or steroid-sparing agents is considered when patients have contraindications or adverse effects from steroids. Overall, cost considerations help tailor treatment plans that balance efficacy, safety, and affordability."

        "pregunta": "11. What criteria were used in the 2012 classification study for assessing response to treatment in PMR?",
        "respuesta": "The 2012 classification study for polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) primarily focused on criteria for diagnosis rather than treatment response. However, in assessing response to treatment in PMR, commonly used criteria include improvement in clinical symptoms (such as morning stiffness and pain), normalization or significant reduction of inflammatory markers (ESR and CRP), and the ability to taper corticosteroids without relapse. Specific standardized criteria for treatment response were not explicitly defined in the 2012 classification study itself."

    {
        "pregunta": "14. How should monitoring of disease activity and adverse events influence glucocorticoid tapering schedules in PMR?",
        "respuesta": "Monitoring of disease activity and adverse events is crucial in guiding glucocorticoid tapering schedules in polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). Tapering should be individualized based on clinical symptoms, inflammatory markers (such as ESR and CRP), and the patient’s tolerance of glucocorticoids. If disease activity remains controlled and adverse events are minimal, gradual dose reduction can continue. However, if symptoms recur or inflammatory markers rise, tapering should be slowed or paused, and the glucocorticoid dose may need to be increased temporarily. Additionally, monitoring for adverse events helps balance the risks of prolonged glucocorticoid exposure against disease control, ensuring tapering proceeds safely."

    {
        "pregunta": "16. Why are NSAIDs generally discouraged as primary therapy in PMR management according to the 2015 EULAR/ACR recommendations?",
        "respuesta": "According to the 2015 EULAR/ACR recommendations, NSAIDs are generally discouraged as primary therapy in polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) management because they are less effective than low-dose glucocorticoids in controlling symptoms and do not adequately prevent disease relapses or complications. Glucocorticoids remain the mainstay of treatment due to their superior efficacy."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "17. What is the rationale behind the need for further research on existing drugs used for PMR?",
        "respuesta": "The rationale for further research on existing drugs used for polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is to better understand their long-term efficacy, safety, optimal dosing, and side effect profiles. This can help improve treatment protocols, minimize adverse effects, and identify patient subgroups that may benefit most, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "18. What is the importance of identifying clinical phenotypes or biomarkers in improving PMR treatment strategies?",
        "respuesta": "Identifying clinical phenotypes or biomarkers in polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is important because it enables more precise diagnosis, helps predict disease course and treatment response, and allows for personalized treatment strategies. This can improve patient outcomes by tailoring therapies to individual disease characteristics, minimizing unnecessary medication exposure, and monitoring disease activity more effectively."

    {
        "pregunta": "19. Under what circumstances might intramuscular (i.m.) methylprednisolone be considered as an alternative to oral glucocorticoids in PMR treatment?",
        "respuesta": "Intramuscular (i.m.) methylprednisolone may be considered as an alternative to oral glucocorticoids in polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) treatment when patients have difficulties with oral medication adherence, experience significant gastrointestinal side effects, or have malabsorption issues that impair oral drug effectiveness. It can also be used in patients who prefer fewer doses or have concerns about daily oral steroid use. However, oral glucocorticoids remain the standard first-line treatment."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "20. How should physicians approach the use of analgesics in PMR patients, according to the guideline?",
        "respuesta": "According to guidelines, physicians should use analgesics in polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) patients primarily to manage pain but not as a substitute for glucocorticoid therapy, which is the main treatment. Analgesics may be considered adjunctively to help control symptoms, especially when glucocorticoid side effects limit their use or during tapering, but they do not address the underlying inflammation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used cautiously, considering the patient's risk profile. Overall, analgesics should be part of a comprehensive management plan tailored to the individual patient."
