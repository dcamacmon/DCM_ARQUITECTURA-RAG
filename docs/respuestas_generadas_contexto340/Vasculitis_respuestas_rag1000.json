In this guideline, we often used indirect comparisons among trials/therapies, frequently relying on network meta-analysis. Stratified analyses among subgroups (e.g., treatment-naive, inadequate response to a TNFi biologic agent) were rarely reported separately in primary trials, limiting our ability to perform network metaanalyses in these important subgroups.

        "respuesta": "In patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), glucocorticoid dosing should be individualized to balance effective disease control with minimizing toxicity. Key points are:\n\n- For active, severe EGPA, either intravenous pulse glucocorticoids (e.g., methylprednisolone) or high-dose daily oral glucocorticoids may be used for remission induction; no data favor one approach over the other, so choice should be based on patient factors.  \n- Glucocorticoids should be combined with non-glucocorticoid immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide or rituximab to improve efficacy and reduce glucocorticoid exposure.  \n- For ongoing therapy, the duration of glucocorticoid treatment is not well established and should be guided by the patient’s clinical condition, values, and preferences.  \n- Many patients require low-dose glucocorticoids long term to maintain control of asthma and allergic symptoms.  \n- The minimum effective glucocorticoid dose should be used to reduce toxicity.  \n- Regular monitoring for glucocorticoid-related adverse effects (e.g., bone health) is recommended.\n\nIn summary, glucocorticoid dosing in EGPA is tailored individually, starting with pulse or high-dose therapy in severe active disease combined with immunosuppression, followed by tapering to the lowest effective dose for maintenance, keeping patient preferences and toxicity risk in mind.",

These diseases affect smalland medium-sized vessels and are characterized by multisystem organ involvement. GPA is characterized histologically by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation in addition to vasculitis. Common clinical manifestations include destructive sinonasal lesions, pulmonary nodules, and pauci-immune glomerulonephritis.

Treatment of refractory disease Recommendation: For patients with severe GPA/MPA that is refractory to treatment with rituximab or cyclophosphamide for remission induction, we conditionally recommend switching treatment to the other therapy over combining the 2 therapies. Disease refractory to remission induction therapy is rare, and there are limited data to guide treatment recommendations. Practitioners should evaluate whether other conditions such as infection could be mimicking vasculitis. However, if a patient's disease is refractory to one remission induction",
            "For patients with GPA/MPA who have experienced relapse with severe disease manifestations and are not receiving rituximab for remission maintenance, we conditionally recommend treatment with rituximab over cyclophosphamide for remission re-induction. Rituximab is more effective than oral cyclophosphamide for reinduction of remission among patients who previously received cyclophosphamide and then experienced relapse, based on subgroup analysis of a randomized controlled trial Recommendation: For patients with GPA/MPA who experienced relapse with severe disease manifestations while receiving rituximab for remission maintenance, we conditionally recommend switching from rituximab to cyclophosphamide over receiving additional rituximab for remission re-induction. Multiple factors can influence whether rituximab or cyclophosphamide treatment (IV or oral) is used, such as time since last rituximab infusion and cumulative cyclophosphamide dose. Cyclophosphamide is recommended if the patient",

            "10. 1002/ acr.24634/ abstract Table 1 2 1 Remission induction for active, severe disease Recommendation: For patients with active, severe GPA/MPA, we conditionally recommend treatment with rituximab over cyclophosphamide for remission induction. Both rituximab and cyclophosphamide, in combination with glucocorticoids, have been used for remission induction in GPA and MPA. Rituximab has been shown to provide similar benefits to cyclophosphamide for remission induction in a randomized controlled trial Cyclophosphamide (dosing provided in Table 1 Recommendation: In patients with GPA/MPA with active glomerulonephritis, we conditionally recommend against the routine addition of plasma exchange to remission induction therapy. Plasma exchange should not be initiated in all patients with active glomerulonephritis but can be considered for patients at higher risk of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who accept a potential increased risk of infection. This recommendation is",
            "situation, preferences, and values should guide selection between them, given their comparable efficacy. Recommendation: For patients with GPA/MPA who are receiving rituximab for remission maintenance, we conditionally recommend scheduled re-dosing over using ANCA titers or CD19+ B cell counts to guide re-dosing. In one randomized trial, patients who received rituximab for remission maintenance based on changes in CD19+ B cell counts and/or ANCA titers had similar rates of relapse as those receiving rituximab as a scheduled dose. However, this study was limited by the small sample size, and there were wide CIs for the effect size Recommendation: For patients with severe GPA/MPA whose disease has entered remission after treatment with cyclophosphamide or rituximab, we conditionally rec ommend treatment with methotrexate or azathioprine over mycophenolate mofetil for remission maintenance. Methotrexate and azathioprine are equally efficacious for remission maintenance Recommendation:"
