        "pregunta": "14. How does the guideline balance the risk of disease flare versus infection when deciding to continue or withhold antirheumatic medications perioperatively?",
        "respuesta": "The guideline balances the risk of disease flare against the risk of infection in perioperative management of antirheumatic medications by carefully weighing the benefits of maintaining disease control against the potential for increased surgical site or systemic infections associated with immunosuppressive therapy.\n\nKey aspects of this balance include:\n\n- **Conditional recommendations** predominate because the quality of evidence is generally low or very low, reflecting uncertainty about the exact magnitude of infection risk versus flare risk.\n\n- For **certain conventional synthetic DMARDs** (e.g., methotrexate, sulfasalazine, hydroxychloroquine, leflunomide, apremilast), continuation through surgery is recommended to minimize flare risk without substantially increasing infection risk.\n\n- For **biologics and targeted therapies with longer half-lives or more profound immunosuppression (e.g., rituximab, abatacept, JAK inhibitors)**, withholding is advised before surgery (often timed near the end of dosing intervals) to reduce infection risk, recognizing that this carries some flare risk that must be managed through planning and shared decision-making.\n\n- In patients with **severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)** involving major organ manifestations, medications including biologics (belimumab, anifrolumab, voclosporin) and immunosuppressants (mycophenolate, azathioprine, calcineurin inhibitors) are **recommended to be continued perioperatively** to prevent disease flares and organ damage, accepting a potentially higher infection risk.\n\n- The **restart of medications postoperatively** is recommended once wound healing is adequate and infection risk is low, typically around 14 days post-surgery, but individualized delays are acceptable based on clinical factors.\n\n- Throughout, the guideline emphasizes **shared decision-making**, incorporating patient values and preferences in situations of uncertain or low-quality evidence and recognizing that the risk-benefit balance may vary by patient, disease severity, and medication.\n\nIn summary, the guideline aims to minimize disease flares by continuing certain lower-risk medications through surgery, while withholding or timing the interruption of higher-risk agents to reduce infection risk—with decisions tailored to disease severity and patient-specific factors. This nuanced approach reflects the limited quality of direct evidence and the need for individualized clinical judgment.",
