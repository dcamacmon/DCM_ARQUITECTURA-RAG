Total antibiotic duration is suggested at 14â21 days.\n\n- **Lyme arthritis with no or minimal response to an initial course of oral antibiotics:** A 2â4 week course of IV ceftriaxone is suggested over a second course of oral antibiotics.\n\nFor other manifestations such as early localized Lyme disease (erythema migrans), oral antibiotics are the standard and sufficient.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- IV antibiotics are indicated and strongly preferred for Lyme disease with parenchymal neurologic involvement.  \n- IV therapy is also appropriate for certain neurologic manifestations without parenchymal involvement but oral therapy can be an alternative.  \n- IV antibiotics are suggested for Lyme arthritis refractory to oral antibiotics.  \n- Lyme carditis treatment includes IV antibiotic use.\n\nIf specific situations outside these are considered, the provided information does not give additional indications for IV antibiotic therapy.",

Comment: If a tick bite cannot be classified with a high level of certainty as a high-risk bite, a wait-and-watch approach is recommended. A tick bite is considered to be high-risk only if it meets the following 3 criteria: the tick bite was from (a) an identified Ixodes spp. vector species, (b) it occurred in a highly endemic area, and (c) the tick was attached for â¥36 hours. IV. What is the preferred antibiotic regimen for the chemoprophylaxis of Lyme disease following a high-risk tick bite? Recommendation: 1. For high-risk Ixodes spp. bites in all age groups, we recommend the administration of a single dose of oral doxycycline within 72 hours of tick removal over observation (strong recommendation,",
            "tweezer (or a comparable device) inserted between the tick body and the skin (good practice statement). 2. We recommend against burning an attached tick (with a match or other heat device) or applying noxious chemicals or petroleum products to coax its detachment (good practice statement). II. Which diagnostic tests should be used following a tick bite? A. Diagnostic tick testing Recommendations: 1. We recommend submitting the removed tick for species identification (good practice statement). are identical except for minor stylistic and spelling differences in keeping with each journal's style. The full guideline is available at http://onlin elibr ary. wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41562/ abstract We recommend against testing a removed III. Who should receive antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent Lyme disease following presentation with a tick bite? Recommendation: 1. We recommend that prophylactic antibiotic therapy be given only to adults and children within 72 hours of removal of an",

In patients with borrelial lymphocytoma, we suggest oral antibiotic therapy for 14 days (weak recommendation, lowquality evidence). XXVII. What is the preferred antibiotic regimen for the treatment of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans? Recommendation: 1. In patients with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, we suggest oral antibiotic therapy for 21-28 days over shorter durations (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). XXVIII. Under what circumstances should a patient with Lyme disease be evaluated for coinfection with A. phagocytophilum or B. microti? Recommendation: 1 To provide thorough transparency, the IDSA/AAN/ACR requires full disclosure of all relationships, regardless of relevancy to the guideline topic. The assessment of disclosed relationships for possible COI is based on the relative weight of the financial relationship (i.e.,",

Comment: Antibiotic therapy for longer than 8 weeks is not expected to provide additional benefit to patients with persistent arthritis if that treatment has included 1 course of IV therapy. XXV. Should patients with persistent symptoms following standard treatment of Lyme disease receive additional antibiotics? Recommendation: 1. For patients who have persistent or recurring nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, pain, or cognitive impairment following recommended treatment for Lyme disease, but who lack objective evidence of reinfection or treatment failure, we recommend against additional antibiotic therapy (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Comment: Evidence of persistent infection or treatment failure would include objective signs of disease activity, such as arthritis, meningitis, or neuropathy. XXVI. What is the preferred antibiotic regimen for the treatment of borrelial lymphocytoma? Recommendation: 1. In patients",
            "neuropathy, radiculoneuropathy, or with other PNS manifestations, we recommend using intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, penicillin G, or oral doxycycline over other antimicrobials (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Comment: Decisions about the choice of antibiotic among these, including the route of administration, should primarily be made based on individual factors such as side effect profile, ease of administration, ability to tolerate oral medication, concerns about compliance unrelated to effectiveness. Treatment route may be changed from IV to oral during treatment. The preferred antibiotic duration is 14-21 days. XIV. Should patients with Lyme disease-related parenchymal involvement of the brain or spinal cord be treated with oral or intravenous antibiotics? Recommendation: 1. In patients with Lyme disease-associated parenchymal involvement of the brain or spinal cord, we recommend using IV over oral antibiotics (strong recommendation, moderate-quality"

In patients with typical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, dementia or cognitive decline, or new-onset seizures, we recommend against routine testing for Lyme disease (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). 3.

Distinguishing single erythema migrans due to Lyme disease from STARI may not be possible clinically unless the responsible tick has been identified IX. What is the preferred diagnostic testing strategy for Lyme neuroborreliosis? Recommendations: 1. When assessing patients for possible Lyme neuroborreliosis involving either the peripheral nervous system (PNS) or central nervous system (CNS), we recommend serum antibody testing rather than PCR or culture of either cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). X. For which neurologic presentations should patients be tested for Lyme disease? Recommendations: 1.

Comment: Symptoms and signs of cardiac involvement in Lyme disease include dyspnea, edema, palpitations, lightheadedness, chest pain, and syncope. XVII. Which patients with Lyme carditis require hospitalization? Recommendation: 1. In patients with or at risk for severe cardiac complications of Lyme disease including those with significant PR prolongation (PR >300 milliseconds), other arrhythmias, or clinical manifestations of myopericarditis, we recommend hospital admission with continuous ECG monitoring (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence).
