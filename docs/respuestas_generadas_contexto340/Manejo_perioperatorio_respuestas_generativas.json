        "pregunta": "1. Under what clinical conditions should antirheumatic medications be restarted after surgery?",
        "respuesta": "Antirheumatic medications should generally be restarted after surgery once the risk of infection is minimized and adequate wound healing is confirmed. Typically, this occurs when there are no signs of surgical site infection, the patient is clinically stable, and oral intake is tolerated. The timing can vary depending on the specific medication, the type of surgery, and the patient's overall condition. For example, non-biologic DMARDs (like methotrexate) are often resumed within 1-2 weeks postoperatively, while biologic agents may be restarted after a longer interval, usually 10-14 days or once the surgical wound shows satisfactory healing and there is no evidence of infection. Decisions should be individualized and made in consultation with rheumatology and surgical teams."

        "pregunta": "4. What is the perioperative management recommendation for abatacept (Orencia) regarding timing of last dose before surgery?",
        "respuesta": "The perioperative management recommendation for abatacept (Orencia) is to withhold the drug prior to surgery to reduce the risk of infection and impaired wound healing. Generally, the last dose should be given approximately 4 weeks before a major surgery if administered intravenously (monthly dosing), or withhold one dose if given subcutaneously (weekly dosing). Abatacept can typically be restarted 10-14 days after surgery once there is adequate wound healing and no signs of infection. Always follow specific institutional protocols and consult with the prescribing physician."

        "pregunta": "6. What is the recommended timing for scheduling surgery in relation to the dosing interval of rituximab?",
        "respuesta": "The recommended timing for scheduling surgery in relation to rituximab dosing is generally to wait at least 4 to 6 weeks after a rituximab infusion before performing surgery. This allows for partial immune system recovery, reducing the risk of infection and impaired wound healing. Additionally, elective surgery is often planned just before the next scheduled rituximab dose to optimize patient safety. However, specific timing may vary based on individual patient factors and clinical judgment."

        "pregunta": "8. How should severe versus non-severe SLE be defined and factored into perioperative medication decisions?",
        "respuesta": "Severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is typically defined by the presence of major organ involvement such as active lupus nephritis, central nervous system lupus, severe hematologic abnormalities, or significant cardiopulmonary disease. Non-severe SLE generally involves milder symptoms such as arthritis, skin manifestations, or serologic activity without major organ damage.\n\nIn perioperative medication decisions, severe SLE requires careful management to control disease activity and prevent flares. This often involves continuing or adjusting immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., corticosteroids, immunomodulators) to maintain disease remission while balancing infection risk. Stress-dose steroids may be necessary if the patient is on long-term corticosteroids. Non-severe SLE patients may require less intensive immunosuppression perioperatively, but medication adjustments should still consider the risk of flare and infection. Close collaboration with rheumatology is recommended for individualized management."

        "pregunta": "13. What is the recommended timing for withholding JAK inhibitors such as tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib before elective surgery?",
        "respuesta": "The recommended timing for withholding JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib) before elective surgery is generally to stop the medication at least 1 week prior to the procedure. This is to reduce the risk of infection and impaired wound healing, given their immunosuppressive effects. However, specific recommendations may vary based on the patient's clinical situation and surgeon's guidance."

    {
        "pregunta": "14. How does the guideline balance the risk of disease flare versus infection when deciding to continue or withhold antirheumatic medications perioperatively?",
        "respuesta": "The guideline balances the risk of disease flare versus infection perioperatively by recommending continuation of antirheumatic medications that have a lower impact on infection risk to maintain disease control, while withholding those that significantly increase infection risk during the perioperative period. This approach aims to minimize the risk of postoperative infections without causing a significant flare of the underlying rheumatic disease. The decision is individualized based on the specific medication, type of surgery, and patient factors."

    {
        "pregunta": "15. Which biologic agents require specific timing considerations before elective surgery, and what are those timings?",
        "respuesta": "Certain biologic agents, particularly tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors and other immunosuppressive biologics, require specific timing considerations before elective surgery to minimize the risk of infection and impaired wound healing.\n\n- **TNF inhibitors (e.g., infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept):** It is generally recommended to withhold these agents before surgery. The timing varies by drug half-life:\n  - *Infliximab:* Stop approximately 4–8 weeks before surgery (typically one dosing cycle).\n  - *Adalimumab:* Stop about 2–4 weeks before surgery.\n  - *Etanercept:* Stop about 1 week before surgery.\n\n- **Other biologics:**\n  - *Rituximab:* Given its long-lasting B-cell depletion, surgery is often delayed until B-cell counts recover, typically 6 months after the last dose.\n  - *Abatacept:* Hold for about 4 weeks prior to surgery.\n  - *IL-6 inhibitors (e.g., tocilizumab):* Hold for at least 2 weeks before surgery.\n\nThese timing recommendations help reduce postoperative infection risk and promote healing. The exact timing may vary based on individual patient factors and specific drug pharmacokinetics. Coordination with the prescribing physician and surgical team is essential."

    {
        "pregunta": "17. What is the recommendation regarding the timing of restarting antirheumatic therapy after total joint arthroplasty?",
        "respuesta": "The recommendation is generally to withhold antirheumatic therapy (such as DMARDs and biologics) around the time of total joint arthroplasty to reduce infection risk and then restart them once wound healing is adequate and there is no sign of infection, typically about 2 weeks postoperatively. However, timing may vary based on the specific medication, patient's infection risk, and clinical judgment. Always follow current guidelines and consult with the treating rheumatologist and surgical team."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "18. How does the presence of severe SLE influence perioperative medication management compared to non-severe SLE?",
        "respuesta": "Severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) typically requires more careful perioperative medication management than non-severe SLE due to higher risks of organ involvement, immunosuppression, and disease flares. In severe SLE, corticosteroids and immunosuppressants may need to be continued or adjusted perioperatively to prevent adrenal insufficiency and disease exacerbation. Additionally, close monitoring and management of anticoagulation, infection risk, and renal function are critical. In contrast, non-severe SLE patients may require less intensive adjustments and monitoring, as their risk of complications is generally lower."

    {
        "pregunta": "19. Why is it important to balance the risk of infection versus disease flare when managing immunosuppressive therapy perioperatively?",
        "respuesta": "Balancing the risk of infection versus disease flare when managing immunosuppressive therapy perioperatively is important because continuing immunosuppression can increase the risk of postoperative infections due to suppressed immune defenses, while stopping or reducing therapy may lead to a flare or worsening of the underlying disease. Careful management aims to minimize infection risk without triggering disease exacerbation, ensuring optimal surgical outcomes and patient safety."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "20. Why does the guideline rely largely on indirect or low-quality evidence for its recommendations on perioperative medication management?",
        "respuesta": "The guideline relies largely on indirect or low-quality evidence for its recommendations on perioperative medication management because high-quality, direct evidence—such as large randomized controlled trials specifically addressing perioperative medication use—is limited or lacking. This is often due to ethical, practical, and logistical challenges in conducting such studies in the perioperative setting, leading guideline developers to base recommendations on observational studies, expert opinion, or evidence from related clinical contexts."
