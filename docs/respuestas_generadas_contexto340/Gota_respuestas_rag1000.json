Patients with more frequent flares (≥2 per year) or nonresolving tophi warrant stronger efforts to optimize ULT, including considering advanced therapies like pegloticase if standard treatments fail.\n\n- **Treatment Efficacy:** ULT dosing should be titrated gradually starting from low doses (e.g., allopurinol <100 mg/day) to achieve target SU, recognizing that optimization improves outcomes and reduces flares and joint damage.\n\n- **Potential Harms:** Clinicians must consider safety concerns, such as allopurinol hypersensitivity (especially in CKD), adverse effects, and treatment costs. The decision to escalate therapy should also weigh these risks against benefits.\n\n- **Patient-Centered Approach:** Shared decision-making is essential, balancing the benefits of reducing SU and preventing flares against medication risks, costs, and patient preferences.\n\n- **Prophylaxis:** Anti-inflammatory prophylaxis during ULT initiation (3–6 months with colchicine, NSAIDs, or glucocorticoids) should be continued to minimize flare risk.\n\n- **Avoid Over-Treatment:** For patients with infrequent flares (<2/year) and no tophi, escalating to therapies like pegloticase is strongly discouraged despite persistent hyperuricemia, to avoid unnecessary risks.\n\nIn summary, clinicians should use a treat-to-target SU approach, closely monitor disease activity, carefully titrate ULT doses to efficacy while minimizing harms, and engage patients in shared decision-making to tailor treatment adjustments effectively.",
