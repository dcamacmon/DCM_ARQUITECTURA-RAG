        "pregunta": "1. Under what conditions does the guideline suggest delaying TJA to improve glycemic control?",
        "respuesta": "The guideline suggests delaying total joint arthroplasty (TJA) to improve glycemic control when a patient's blood glucose levels are poorly controlled, typically indicated by an elevated HbA1c above a certain threshold (often >7.0% to 8.0%) or persistently high fasting blood glucose levels. Optimizing glycemic control before surgery reduces the risk of postoperative complications such as infections and impaired wound healing."

        "pregunta": "2. How is radiographic severity of osteoarthritis or osteonecrosis assessed when considering TJA?",
        "respuesta": "Radiographic severity of osteoarthritis (OA) or osteonecrosis (ON) when considering total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is typically assessed using standardized grading systems. For osteoarthritis, the Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading scale is commonly used, which evaluates joint space narrowing, osteophyte formation, subchondral sclerosis, and cysts on plain radiographs to classify severity from grade 0 (no OA) to grade 4 (severe OA). For osteonecrosis, the Ficat and Arlet classification or the Steinberg staging system is often employed, which assess radiographic changes such as sclerosis, cystic changes, subchondral collapse, and joint space narrowing to stage the disease progression. These radiographic assessments help determine the extent of joint damage and guide the timing and appropriateness of TJA."

    {
        "pregunta": "18. What limitations in current evidence make it difficult to establish firm recommendations on timing of TJA?",
        "respuesta": "Limitations in current evidence that make it difficult to establish firm recommendations on the timing of total joint arthroplasty (TJA) include variability in study designs, small sample sizes, lack of randomized controlled trials, heterogeneous patient populations, and inconsistent definitions of timing intervals. Additionally, differences in comorbidities, surgical techniques, and outcome measures across studies hinder the ability to draw definitive conclusions about optimal timing."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "19. How should patients with bone loss and severe deformity or ligamentous instability be managed concerning timing of TJA?",
        "respuesta": "Patients with bone loss and severe deformity or ligamentous instability typically require careful preoperative planning before total joint arthroplasty (TJA). Management often involves addressing bone defects and soft tissue balancing either through staged procedures or specialized implants during TJA. The timing of TJA should be individualized, ensuring that any active infection is eradicated and that deformities are optimized as much as possible prior to surgery. In some cases, corrective osteotomies or soft tissue procedures may be performed before or concurrently with TJA to improve joint stability and implant fixation. Overall, multidisciplinary evaluation and meticulous surgical planning are crucial to optimize outcomes."
    },
    {
        "pregunta": "20. How does the guideline address heterogeneity among populations with OA versus osteonecrosis with secondary arthritis in terms of surgical timing?",
        "respuesta": "The guideline recognizes that osteoarthritis (OA) and osteonecrosis with secondary arthritis represent different pathological processes, which can influence the timing of surgical intervention. For OA, surgical timing is generally based on the severity of symptoms and functional impairment, often after conservative treatments have failed. In contrast, for osteonecrosis with secondary arthritis, earlier surgical intervention may be recommended to prevent further joint deterioration and collapse. Thus, the guideline addresses heterogeneity by recommending individualized surgical timing that considers the underlying condition, disease progression, and patient-specific factors rather than a one-size-fits-all approach."
