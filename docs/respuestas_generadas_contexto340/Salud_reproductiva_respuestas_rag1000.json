Optimal duration of prophylactic LMWH for asymptomatic aPL-positive patients undergoing ovarian stimulation has not been studied; this is a decision best made in consultation with the reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist. The treatment is often continued until estrogen levels return to near-physiologic levels if no pregnancy occurs. Patients with OB APS will continue therapy throughout pregnancy. Aspirin is not commonly used prior to oocyte retrieval (it will be started after retrieval if indicated) given concern that its prolonged action may increase bleeding risk at the time of the retrieval. Patients receiving regular anticoagulation therapy with vitamin K antagonists for thrombotic APS should transition to therapeutic-dose LMWH for ART (usually enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours), with this treatment withheld for retrieval and resumed subsequently, to continue throughout pregnancy.

Most reports of aPL-positive patients undergoing IVF describe the use of empiric prophylactic anticoagulation due to concern regarding further increased risk of potentially life-threatening thrombosis from elevated estrogen levels during ovarian stimulation. In subfertile patients with RMD who desire pregnancy, have stable/quiescent disease, and have asymptomatic positive aPL, OB APS, or treated thrombotic APS, we conditionally recommend ART with anticoagulation, as described below. We conditionally recommend prophylactic anticoagulation therapy with heparin or low molecular weight heparin in asymptomatic aPL-positive patients during ART procedures The increased risk of organ-or life-threatening thrombosis due to high estrogen levels greatly outweighs the low risk of bleeding or other complications of unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).

We appreciate and stress, however, that benefit in individual high-risk circumstances, such as triple-positive aPL or strongly positive LAC results, advanced maternal age, or IVF pregnancy, may outweigh risks of this therapy, and decisions should be made with discussion between physician and patient, weighing potential risks and benefits.

We strongly recommend prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin or LMWH in women with OB APS, and we strongly recommend therapeutic anticoagulation in women with thrombotic APS, during ART procedures. The strength of these recommendations rests on the severity of the risk of organ-or life-threatening thrombosis during ovarian stimulation. An added risk for thrombosis is ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, an important, uncommon complication consisting of capillary leak syndrome (with pleural effusion and ascites) and, in severe cases, arterial and venous thrombosis and renal failure LMWH is used most commonly.
