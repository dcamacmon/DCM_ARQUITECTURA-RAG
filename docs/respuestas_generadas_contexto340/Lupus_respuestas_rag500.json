Triple therapy may include glucocorticoids plus MPAA with belimumab, MPAA with CNI, or ELNT low-dose cyclophosphamide with belimumab (with MPAA substituting for CYC after completion of the cyclophosphamide course).\n\n**Reasons for their preference**:\n\n- These immunosuppressive agents form the backbone of treatment regimens that balance efficacy in controlling active lupus nephritis while allowing for glucocorticoid dose reduction.  \n- Combination regimens including these agents target different immunologic pathways, potentially improving renal outcomes and reducing reliance on glucocorticoids, thus minimizing their toxicity.  \n- Evidence-based protocols like the ELNT regimen provide structured approaches with defined dosing for cyclophosphamide.\n\nIn refractory cases after failure of two standard therapies, treatment escalation by adding anti-CD20 agents (e.g., rituximab) or combining three non-glucocorticoid immunosuppressives (MPAA, belimumab, and CNI) is conditionally recommended to intensify immunosuppression.\n\n**Summary:** MPAA, belimumab, CNI, and low-dose cyclophosphamide are preferred immunosuppressive agents in lupus nephritis due to their roles in effective immunomodulation, enabling glucocorticoid sparing, and targeting multiple pathogenic mechanisms with evidence-supported regimens.",

OTHER LUPUS KIDNEY DISEASE: GPS: Alternative etiologies of kidney dysfunction in people with SLE should be carefully excluded, including noninflammatory etiologies such as hypertensive,",
            "this guideline, we emphasize the importance of prompt kidney biopsy and LN treatment and propose triple therapy as the most desirable therapy for LN, preferring MPAA regimens over CYC regimens. We propose a lower dose glucocorticoid regimen to minimize toxicity, with a prednisone goal of ≤5 mg/day by 6 months of therapy, and a total therapy duration of 3-5 years for those achieving complete renal response. Discussion between clinicians and patients is critical because multiple factors impact",
            "any LN class with an inadequate renal response (i.e., have not achieved at least a partial renal response by 6-12 months) we conditionally recommend escalation of treatment: • For initial DUAL therapy, escalate to TRIPLE therapy. • For initial TRIPLE therapy, change to an alternative TRIPLE therapy or consider addition of an anti-CD20 agent as a second immunosuppressive. In people with any LN class with refractory disease (i.e., failed two standard therapy courses), we conditionally recommend"
