        "pregunta": "2. What are tibiofemoral knee braces, and for which patients with OA are they strongly recommended?",
        "respuesta": "Tibiofemoral knee braces are orthotic devices designed to provide support and stability to the knee joint by applying corrective forces to the tibiofemoral compartment. They are primarily used to offload stress from the affected compartment of the knee, typically in patients with unicompartmental osteoarthritis (OA), such as medial or lateral compartment OA. These braces help reduce pain, improve function, and delay the need for surgical intervention. They are strongly recommended for patients with mild to moderate unicompartmental knee OA who experience malalignment (varus or valgus deformity) contributing to uneven joint loading."
