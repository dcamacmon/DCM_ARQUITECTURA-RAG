1. What are the key guiding principles for determining the optimal timing of elective hip or knee arthroplasty for patients with symptomatic moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis or advanced symptomatic osteonecrosis with secondary arthritis?
2. What nonoperative therapies should be tried and found ineffective before considering elective total joint arthroplasty (TJA) for patients with radiographically moderate-to-severe OA or advanced ON with secondary arthritis?
3. How should patient preferences be incorporated into the decision-making process for elective TJA in patients with symptomatic OA or ON?
4. What are the recommendations regarding modifying risk factors such as BMI, glycemic control, and nicotine dependence before proceeding with TJA?
5. What is the rationale behind the conditional recommendation to proceed to TJA without delay over delaying arthroplasty for a trial of physical therapy in the defined population?
6. Why is mandated physical therapy not recommended to delay or avoid surgery for patients indicated for TJA in the clinical guideline?
7. In patients with a BMI of â‰¥50, what is the conditional recommendation regarding proceeding to TJA without delaying to achieve weight reduction to a BMI of <50?
8. For patients with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, what is the conditional recommendation regarding delaying TJA to improve glycemic control?
9. Why is proceeding to TJA without delay recommended over delaying TJA for patients with bone loss with deformity or severe ligamentous instability in the defined population?
10. What are the considerations for patients with a neuropathic joint in the conditional recommendation to proceed to TJA without delay over delaying for optimization of non-life-threatening conditions?
