1. What are the recommended screening interventions for interstitial lung disease in people with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs)?
2. How does the risk of developing interstitial lung disease vary among different autoimmune rheumatic diseases?
3. What are the high-risk factors for ILD progression in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic sclerosis (SSc), and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM)?
4. Why is screening with pulmonary function tests (PFTs) recommended over history and physical examination alone for patients at increased risk of developing ILD?
5. What is the diagnostic accuracy of high-resolution computed tomography of the chest (HRCT chest) for detecting ILD?
6. Why is screening with chest radiography not recommended for patients at increased risk of developing ILD?
7. What is the role of ambulatory desaturation testing in screening for ILD in patients with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases?
8. How often should patients with SARDs, such as systemic sclerosis and mixed connective tissue disease, undergo ILD screening tests?
9. What is the recommended multidisciplinary approach for monitoring patients with identified SARD-associated ILD?
10. Why is monitoring with both PFTs and HRCT chest recommended over PFTs alone for patients with SARD-ILD?
