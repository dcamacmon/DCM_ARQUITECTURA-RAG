Answer B is factually inaccurate, as it claims no information is available, which is untrue when considering the full guideline.

Answer B's high completeness given retrieval is misleading, as it's simply complete in its statement that no answer is available in the provided text.

The retrieved context only mentions mood, sleep, pain, and coping, while Answer A correctly includes critical symptoms like reduced range of motion, crepitus, and muscle weakness.  Answer B also doesn't fully capture or contextualize the symptoms it listed, potentially missing some nuances in explaining *why* those additional symptoms arise.
