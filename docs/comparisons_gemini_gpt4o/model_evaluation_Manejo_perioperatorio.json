        "comment": "Gemini evaluation output:\nWhich answer is better overall: B\nJustification: Answer A admits it cannot answer the question. Answer B, while lacking key details regarding specific medication recommendations, at least acknowledges the existence and focus of the 2022 ACR/AAHKS guideline, correctly identifying infection risk reduction as a primary concern and mentioning the principle of shared decision-making. It is thus slightly more helpful than a complete deferral.\ni. Differences in Factual Accuracy and Safety: Neither answer provides specific medication guidance, thus direct factual accuracy comparisons are difficult.  However, Answer B is more accurate in broadly characterizing the guideline's goals, while Answer A provides nothing. Safety-wise, neither poses a risk, as B sticks to general principles without recommending specific actions, and A defers completely.\nii. Whether Answer B’s faithfulness to its limited Retrieved Context aligned with the overall guideline truth: Answer B is entirely faithful to the retrieved context. It correctly reflects the limited information available in the snippets.  The problem is the context itself doesn't contain the specific recommendations requested in the prompt.  The context focuses on the *existence* and scope of the guideline, not its content.\niii. If the Retrieved Context seemed sufficient/good based on comparing Answer B’s Completeness_Given_Retrieval vs Completeness_Overall and its Faithfulness vs Factual Accuracy: The retrieved context is extremely poor.  While Answer B extracts all it can from the provided snippets (high Completeness_Given_Retrieval and Faithfulness), it still fails to answer the question about specific recommendations (low Completeness_Overall and limited Factual Accuracy regarding actual medication management).  This discrepancy highlights how insufficient the retrieval was for addressing the question.  The provided context discussed the guideline's existence and scope, not its content.  The retrieval engine provided context about *the guideline*, but not the *content within* the guideline relevant to the question."

        "comment": "Gemini evaluation output:\nWhich answer is better overall: B\nJustification: Answer A provides no information other than admitting it doesn't know. Answer B, while lacking the specific recommendations due to the retrieved context lacking them, gives a good overview of what the guideline *is* and who it's for.  Crucially, it emphasizes the increased risk of infection and thromboembolic events, implicitly acknowledging the need for careful management without specifying what that management is.  It also correctly points out the need to consult the full guideline.\ni. Differences in Factual Accuracy and Safety: Answer A is not factually inaccurate, but rather entirely absent of factual information.  Answer B provides accurate high-level context around the guideline's purpose and target population but lacks the specific drug recommendations.  This makes B slightly more helpful but also carries a risk if a user mistakes its general information as complete guidance.  However, B does clearly state that it doesn't contain specific drug recommendations and recommends consulting the full guideline.\nii. Whether Answer B’s faithfulness to its limited Retrieved Context aligned with the overall guideline truth: Answer B is completely faithful to the retrieved context.  The issue is the context *itself* lacked the table with specific recommendations.\niii. If the Retrieved Context seemed sufficient/good based on comparing Answer B’s Completeness_Given_Retrieval vs Completeness_Overall and its Faithfulness vs Factual Accuracy:  The retrieved context is insufficient to answer the core question.  B's high Completeness_Given_Retrieval score reflects its thorough use of the provided snippet, while the low Completeness_Overall score reflects the snippet's inadequacy regarding the user's question.  B's high Faithfulness score and relatively low Factual Accuracy further underscore that the limitation lies in the retrieval, not the LLM's handling of the context."

Both appropriately recommend consulting the full guideline for specific recommendations. Answer B is slightly less concise but adds relevant information without hallucinating.

However, Answer A is slightly better due to its stricter faithfulness to *only* the retrieved context. Answer B adds context regarding balancing the risks of flares and infection, which, while true and helpful, is not present in the provided retrieved snippet. Therefore, Answer A demonstrates perfect faithfulness and conciseness while still providing a complete answer based on the retrieved text.

Both correctly address the core question.\nWhether Answer B’s faithfulness to its limited Retrieved Context aligned with the overall guideline truth: Answer B's faithfulness is slightly lower because of the inclusion of the risk-balancing statement, which is not present in the retrieved context. However, this added information *is* consistent with the overall guideline's intent.\nIf the Retrieved Context seemed sufficient/good based on comparing Answer B’s Completeness_Given_Retrieval vs Completeness_Overall and its Faithfulness vs Factual Accuracy: The retrieved context was excellent.  Answer B's slight drop in faithfulness is due to adding accurate information from elsewhere in the guideline rather than hallucinating.

While Answer A provides general information about glucocorticoid management in surgical settings, it suggests \"stress dosing\" which is specifically *not* recommended by the guideline.  This makes Answer A potentially harmful. Answer B correctly reflects the guideline's conditional recommendation to continue the current glucocorticoid dose, thereby avoiding potential harm from supraphysiologic doses.

The retrieved context was sufficient to answer the question thoroughly, evident from Answer B's high Completeness_Given_Retrieval and Completeness_Overall scores, both of which surpass Answer A.

The differences in factual accuracy and safety are stark; A provides nothing useful, while B offers precise and safe guidance aligned with the guidelines.

They both successfully extract the key information about continuing belimumab and timing surgery around the rituximab cycle.  However, Answer A is slightly more concise while still providing the important rationale related to belimumab's use in severe SLE and its relatively low infection risk. Answer B adds the detail about months 5 or 6, which, while true, doesn't add much value given the \"last month of the cycle\" guidance.  Both answers' faithfulness to the retrieved context aligned perfectly with the overall guideline's recommendations. The retrieved context was clearly sufficient to answer the question completely and accurately, as evidenced by the high scores for both Completeness_Given_Retrieval and Completeness_Overall, as well as the alignment between Faithfulness and Factual Accuracy scores. There are no safety concerns with either answer.  Answer A is marginally better due to its conciseness."
