While Answer A provides general information about outcome measures, it lacks the specific details of ACR20 and PASI75 which are explicitly mentioned as accepted measures by regulatory agencies in the retrieved context. Answer B correctly identifies these key measures demonstrating a clear advantage in terms of accuracy and relevance. Although Answer B doesn't achieve full completeness against the *entire* guideline (which wasn't expected given the retrieval), its faithfulness to the provided excerpt, coupled with its high accuracy makes it much more reliable and informative than the more general answer A.\ni. Differences in Factual Accuracy and Safety: Answer B demonstrates significantly higher factual accuracy by citing the specific, accepted outcome measures. Answer A is less precise, potentially leading to misinterpretations about which measures are actually used by regulatory agencies. This increased accuracy in B also enhances safety by providing clinically relevant information.\nii. Whether Answer B’s faithfulness to its limited Retrieved Context aligned with the overall guideline truth: Yes, Answer B's faithfulness to the retrieved context aligns perfectly with the information within that excerpt, and importantly, this information is indeed accurate within the larger guideline context.\niii. If the Retrieved Context seemed sufficient/good based on comparing Answer B’s Completeness_Given_Retrieval vs Completeness_Overall and its Faithfulness vs Factual Accuracy: The retrieved context was a good excerpt for this specific question. While it didn't capture the full breadth of the guideline's discussion on outcome measures (leading to a slightly lower Completeness_Overall score), it provided the crucial and specific information needed to accurately answer the user's query.  The perfect Faithfulness and Factual Accuracy scores further support the sufficiency of the retrieved context in this instance."

        "comment": "Gemini evaluation output:\nWhich answer is better overall: A\nJustification: Answer A, while general, provides a reasonably accurate overview of outcome measures considered in PsA treatment approvals. It correctly mentions joint symptoms, skin symptoms, and functional/quality of life improvements.  Although it lacks specific examples (like ACR20 or PASI75), it doesn't contain inaccuracies. Answer B, while perfectly faithful to the retrieved context (which lacks a direct answer to the question), fails to provide any helpful information.  The retrieved context *does* mention ACR20 and PASI75 as accepted outcome measures but in a roundabout way, making it difficult for the RAG model to extract and synthesize that information.  The RAG model appropriately chooses not to hallucinate an answer, but this leaves it with an essentially useless response.\nSpecifically:\ni. Differences in Factual Accuracy and Safety: Answer A demonstrates better factual accuracy by aligning with general principles of PsA outcome measures.  Answer B is not inaccurate, per se, but its lack of information makes it less helpful from a clinical standpoint.  Answer A is also “safer” in that it does provide some useful context, whereas Answer B offers nothing concrete.\nii. Whether Answer B’s faithfulness to its limited Retrieved Context aligned with the overall guideline truth: Answer B IS faithful to its retrieved context, which unfortunately didn't contain a direct answer to the question.  While the retrieved context *did* allude to ACR20 and PASI75, the phrasing made it difficult for the model to extract that information reliably.  This highlights a core challenge with RAG – if the retrieved context isn't optimal, even a perfectly faithful model will produce a subpar answer.\niii. If the Retrieved Context seemed sufficient/good based on comparing Answer B’s Completeness_Given_Retrieval vs Completeness_Overall and its Faithfulness vs Factual Accuracy: The retrieved context was *not* sufficient.  Although elements of a good answer were present, they were not readily extractable by the model.  This is evidenced by Answer B's low completeness scores (both given retrieval and overall) despite its perfect faithfulness score. The mismatch between faithfulness and factual accuracy/completeness reinforces that a good RAG answer relies heavily on the quality of retrieval.  In this case, a more targeted retrieval would likely have led to a much better response from Answer B."
