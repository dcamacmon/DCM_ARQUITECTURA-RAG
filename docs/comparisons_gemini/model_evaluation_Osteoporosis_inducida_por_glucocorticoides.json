While Answer A mentions bisphosphonates, it lacks the nuance and specificity of Answer B, which correctly prioritizes teriparatide based on the provided context.  Answer A also includes general lifestyle recommendations, which are relevant but not the primary focus for very high-risk patients where medication is crucial.\ni.
