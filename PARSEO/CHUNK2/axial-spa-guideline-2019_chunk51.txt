with stable AS, we conditionally recommend against obtaining a spinal or pelvis MRI to confirm inactivity (new, PICO 69). In adults with stable nonradiographic axial SpA, we conditionally recommend against obtaining a spine or pelvis MRI to confirm inactivity (new, PICO 82). Because the clinical assessment of inflammation in axial SpA has many limitations, questions may arise about whether subclinical inflammation that could be detected by MRI is being "missed" by either the physical
