|PTH/PTHrP Agonists (TER, ABL, Anti-RANKL, DEN)|We conditionally recommend PTH/PTHrP over anti-resorptives in patients at very high risk of fracture. We conditionally recommend DENÂ§# or PTH/PTHrP over oral and IV BP in high risk of fracture. In moderate risk, we conditionally recommend BP, DEN, or PTH/PTHrP in no preferred order among these agents.|-|
