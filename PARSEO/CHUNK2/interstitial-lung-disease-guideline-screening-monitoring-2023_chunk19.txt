66% specific), despite very low certainty of evidence (one observational study), For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend screening with HRCT chest over history and physical examination or PFTs alone. Very low-certainty evidence suggests that the HRCT chest has a sensitivity of 95.7% and specificity of 63.8% for the detection of ILD (â‰¥20% extent of lung involvement). Low-certainty evidence from five observational studies suggests that PFTs alone may
