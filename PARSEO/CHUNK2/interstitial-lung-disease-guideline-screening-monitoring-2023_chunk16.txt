ILD compared with other SARDs, but a subset of people with long-standing limited cutaneous SSc can have mild, stable ILD. Patients with RA-ILD with high-titer anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) or rheumatoid factor positivity, patients with SSc-ILD with early diffuse cutaneous disease and/or Scl-70 positivity, and patients with IIM-ILD with anti-melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (anti-MDA-5), anti-synthetase, or overlap antibodies (eg, PM-Scl, Ku, Ro52) are at increased risk
