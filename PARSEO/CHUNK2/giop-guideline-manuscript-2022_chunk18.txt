or DEN over BP (PICO 1.4c-1.28.c). For adults â‰¥40 years with high fracture risk, we conditionally recommend IV or oral BP, PTH/PTHrP, or DEN over Raloxifene (RAL) or Romosozumab (ROM) (PICO 1.4c-1.28.c). High-certainty evidence indicates that oral BP prevents vertebral fractures in GIOP Compared to BP and RAL, PTH/PTHrP, DEN, and ROM require sequential therapy with an anti-resorptive agent to prevent bone losses. Discontinuation of DEN must be followed by a BP beginning at 6 to 7 months after
