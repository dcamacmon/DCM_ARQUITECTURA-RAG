were raised about accurate oxygen saturation measurement in patients with Raynaud phenomenon, particularly those with SSc, because of poor finger perfusion. Thus, an ear or forehead oxygen saturation monitor is preferable in these circumstances. For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend against monitoring with chest radiography. One case-control study demonstrated a low sensitivity (64.0%) and moderate specificity (73.6%) of chest radiography relative to HRCT chest for identifying
