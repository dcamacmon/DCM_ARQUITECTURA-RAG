benefit would likely be marginal. The addition of sulfasalazine could be considered in the rare patient whose axial symptoms are well-controlled with TNFi but who has active peripheral arthritis. In adults with either active or stable AS on treatment with TNFi, we conditionally recommend against co-treatment with low-dose methotrexate (new, PICO 64). In rheumatoid arthritis, the likelihood of TNFi discontinuation is lower among patients who receive co-treatment with methotrexate, perhaps by
