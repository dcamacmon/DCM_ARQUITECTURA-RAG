<p>*Hold only if disease activity allows. Non-rheumatology providers, e.g., general pediatricians and internists, are encouraged to give the influenza vaccination and then consult with the patientâ€™s rheumatology provider about holding methotrexate to avoid a missed vaccination opportunity.</p>

<p>**Give influenza vaccination on schedule. Delay any subsequent rituximab dosing for at least 2 weeks after influenza vaccination if disease activity allows.</p>
