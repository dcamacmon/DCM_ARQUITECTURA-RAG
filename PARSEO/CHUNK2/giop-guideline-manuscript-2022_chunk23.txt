at very high fracture risk due to treatment with one or more courses of high-dose GC therapy (mean dose prednisone equivalent ≥30 mg daily for ≥30 days) or cumulative GC dose ≥5 g over 1 year, we conditionally recommend treating with PTH/PTHrP over anti-resorptive agents regardless of FRAX score or BMD. We strongly recommend oral BP over no treatment and conditionally recommend an IV BP, DEN, RAL or ROM over no treatment. The relative risk for vertebral fracture was 14 and for hip fractures was
