We strongly recommend against adding prednisone to prophylactic-dose heparin or LMWH and low-dose aspirin in patients in whom standard therapy has been unsuccessful, since there are no controlled studies demonstrating a benefit. We acknowledge, however, that this recommendation is based on a lack of compelling data rather than data showing no clear benefit, and also that potential risk with this therapy is likely to be strongly affected by daily dosage, with higher doses imparting greater risk
