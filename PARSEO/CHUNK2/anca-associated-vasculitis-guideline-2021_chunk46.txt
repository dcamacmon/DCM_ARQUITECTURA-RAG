randomized controlled trial Recommendation: For patients with GPA/MPA who experienced relapse with severe disease manifestations while receiving rituximab for remission maintenance, we conditionally recommend switching from rituximab to cyclophosphamide over receiving additional rituximab for remission re-induction. Multiple factors can influence whether rituximab or cyclophosphamide treatment (IV or oral) is used, such as time since last rituximab infusion and cumulative cyclophosphamide dose.
