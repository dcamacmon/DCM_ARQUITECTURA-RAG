evidence from five observational studies suggests that PFTs alone may be insufficient to detect ILD among patients with newly diagnosed SARDs. For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with chest radiography. Three studies indicated a low sensitivity of chest radiography (58%-64%), limiting utility as a screening test for ILD. For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with
