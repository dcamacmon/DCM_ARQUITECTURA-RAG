resources for risk factor modification such as poor glycemic control. It may be difficult to complete studies with enough power to demonstrate the effectiveness of risk factor modification in part due to the relatively low rate of specific complications associated with TJA, even in high-risk patients. Nevertheless, future research is clearly needed in this distinct patient population. Quasi-experimental study designs may be more fit to answer some of these questions. Another limitation of the
