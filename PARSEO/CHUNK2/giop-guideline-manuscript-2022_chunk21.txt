Multiple studies have shown that 12 months of ROM followed by an anti-resorptive agent (BP or DEN) for 12 month prevents fractures in patients with postmenopausal OP when compared to antiresorptive agent only In adults with low fracture risk, we strongly recommend against adding oral or IV BP, PTH/PTHrP, RAL, DEN, or
