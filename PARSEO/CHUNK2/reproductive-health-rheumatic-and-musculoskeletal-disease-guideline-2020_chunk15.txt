activity and history of thrombosis In SLE patients with stable or low disease activity who are not positive for aPL, we strongly recommend use of effective contraceptives (i.e., hormonal contraceptives or IUDs) over less effective options or no contraception, and we conditionally recommend the highly effective IUDs or subdermal progestin implant because they have the lowest failure rates. We conditionally recommend against use of the transdermal estrogen-progestin patch in patients with SLE.
