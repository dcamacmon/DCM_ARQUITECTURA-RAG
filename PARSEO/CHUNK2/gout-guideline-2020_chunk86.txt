|We strongly recommend initiating concomitant antiinflammatory prophylaxis therapy (e.g., colchicine, NSAIDs, prednisone/prednisolone) over no antiinflammatory prophylaxis.|9|Moderate|
|The choice of specific antiinflammatory prophylaxis should be based upon patient factors.| | |
|We strongly recommend continuing prophylaxis for 3â€“6 months rather than &lt;3 months, with ongoing evaluation and continued prophylaxis as needed if the patient continues to experience flares.|9|Moderate|
