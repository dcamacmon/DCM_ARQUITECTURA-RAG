risk who chose not to start OP therapy (except calcium and vitamin D), we strongly recommend fracture risk reassessment every 1 to 2 years (PICO 9.1-9.4).

Fracture risk reassessment includes clinical fracture risk history, new symptomatic fractures, FRAX, BMD, VFA, and/or spine x-rays. Repeating DXA assessment every 1 to 2 years allows providers to detect the least significant BMD change
