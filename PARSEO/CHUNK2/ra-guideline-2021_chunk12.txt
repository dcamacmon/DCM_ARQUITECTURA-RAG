over methotrexate plus a non-TNF inhibitor bDMARD or tsDMARD for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity There is very low-certainty evidence supporting the superiority of methotrexate plus a non-TNF inhibitor bDMARD or tsDMARD over methotrexate monotherapy in DMARD-naive patients; thus, methotrexate monotherapy is strongly preferred given the lack of proven benefit and additional risks and costs associated with the addition of a non-TNF inhibitor bDMARD or tsDMARD in this
