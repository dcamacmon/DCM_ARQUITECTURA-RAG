rituximab therapy for patients at target is conditionally recommended over switching to a different bDMARD or tsDMARD Continuing rituximab in patients who are at target is preferred because of the uncertain clinical significance of hypogammaglobulinemia in patients without infection. Although an increased risk of infection has been described in RA patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, it is not known if a switch in DMARDs in patients who are at target is more effective in lowering infection risk
