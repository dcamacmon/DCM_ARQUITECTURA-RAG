| For people with RA-ILD, SjD-ILD, and MCTD-ILD, we suggest PFTs for monitoring every 3-12 months rather than shorter or longer intervals, for the first year, then less frequently once stable. |
| For people with SARDs-ILD, we do not provide guidance about frequency of routine HRCT chest for monitoring ILD but suggest HRCT when clinically indicated. |
