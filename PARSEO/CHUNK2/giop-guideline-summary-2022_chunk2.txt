BPs, PTH/PTHrP, and denosumab (DEN) are also options and are conditionally recommended given lack of fracture prevention data in GIOP populations. For adults at high risk, we conditionally recommended DEN or PTH/PTHrP over BP. For adults at very high risk, we conditionally recommended PTH/PTHrP over antiresorptives We strongly recommend oral BP over no treatment in high and very high fracture risk due to fracture reduction in GIOP. We conditionally recommend PTH/PTHrP over anti-resorptives in
