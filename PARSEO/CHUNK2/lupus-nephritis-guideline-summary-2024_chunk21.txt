clinicians and patients is critical because multiple factors impact therapy choice. We do not specify a particular CNI because comparative effectiveness and safety studies are not available, and accessibility may dictate CNI choice. We encourage shared decision-making patients with discussion of all therapy options, awareness of pill/medication burden, and close monitoring to reach the shared goals of preservation of kidney function and overall health, as well as optimal quality of life.
