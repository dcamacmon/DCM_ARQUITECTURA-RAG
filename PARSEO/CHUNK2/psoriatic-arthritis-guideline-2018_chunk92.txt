the negative impact of adverse events (e.g., fatigue, nausea, and malaise) on quality of life and social participation, and thus the risk for these adverse events weighed heavily in patients' decision-making. The concept of treat-to-target was challenging for patients. Although they saw value in improved outcomes, they also thought this strategy could increase costs to the patient (e.g., copayments, time traveling to more frequent appointments, etc.) and potentially increase adverse events.
