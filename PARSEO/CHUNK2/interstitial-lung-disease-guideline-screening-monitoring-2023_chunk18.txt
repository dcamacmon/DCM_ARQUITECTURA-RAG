defining the magnitude of risk within diseases was beyond the scope of this guideline, Table 1 1 2 For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend screening with PFTs over history and physical examination or ambulatory desaturation testing alone. Given the poor diagnostic accuracy of history (dry cough: 15% sensitive, 89% specific) and examination (dry "velcro" crackles: 69% sensitive, 66% specific), despite very low certainty of evidence (one observational
