of the evidence, this is a strong recommendation as good clinical practice. Reassessment allows providers to determine if patients continuing GC and OP therapy are maintaining, gaining, or losing BMD, warranting possible changes in OP therapy. Yearly BMD assessment until a stable BMD is reached may be preferred in very high fracture risk patients. For adults stopping GC and remaining at moderate, high, or very high fracture risk, we strongly recommend continuing OP therapy (PICO 12.1-12.6).
