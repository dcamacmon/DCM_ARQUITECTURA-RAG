low-dose allopurinol (≤100 mg/day and lower in patients with CKD [stage ≥3] ) and febuxostat (≤40 mg/day) with subsequent dose titration over starting at a higher dose is strongly recommended. Starting treatment with low-dose probenecid (500 mg once to twice daily) with subsequent dose titration over starting at a higher dose is conditionally recommended. A lower starting dose of any ULT reduces the risk of flare associated with initiation Certainty of evidence For patients starting any ULT, we
