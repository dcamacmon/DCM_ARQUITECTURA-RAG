Transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) is strongly recommended against in patients with knee and/or hip OA. Studies examining the use of TENS have been of low quality with small size and variable controls, making comparisons across trials difficult. Studies have demonstrated a lack of benefit for knee OA.
