lack of blinding and study attrition; 3) small sample sizes resulting in imprecision; and 4) heterogeneity of study designs (e.g., various interventions [comprehensive therapy versus an individual component], comparators, and outcomes) that prevented pooling results through a formal meta-analysis. Many of these issues are inherent to research evaluating the considered interventions (e.g., exercise, diet). These conditional recommendations indicate that clinicians should engage in shared
