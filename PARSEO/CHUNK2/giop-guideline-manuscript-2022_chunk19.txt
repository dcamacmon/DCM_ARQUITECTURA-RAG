of DEN must be followed by a BP beginning at 6 to 7 months after the last DEN dose to prevent rapidly progressive vertebral fractures. Additionally, IV BP, DEN, and ROM have increased risk of atypical femur fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw compared to oral BP Very low level evidence does not support using combination therapy (eg, PTH/PTHrP and DEN, PTH/PTHrP and BP) in GIOP. In patients with postmenopausal OP, studies have shown synergistic increases in BMD with combination of PTH with IV
