The major limitation of the work arises from the limitations in the evidence. In this guideline, we often used indirect comparisons among trials/therapies, frequently relying on network meta-analysis. Stratified analyses among subgroups (e.g., treatment-naive, inadequate response to a TNFi biologic agent) were rarely reported separately in primary trials, limiting our ability to perform network metaanalyses in these important subgroups. For most clinical scenarios (PICO questions) there were
