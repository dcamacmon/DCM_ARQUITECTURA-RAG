|For allopurinol and febuxostat, we strongly recommend starting at a low dose with subsequent dose titration to target over starting at a higher dose (e.g., &lt;100 mg/day [and lower in patients with CKD] for allopurinol or &lt;40 mg/day for febuxostat).|7|Moderate|
|For probenecid, we conditionally recommend starting at a low dose (500 mg once or twice daily) with dose titration over starting at a higher dose.| | |
