all adults (≥18 years old) initiating or continuing GC therapy ≥2.5 mg/day for >3 months, we strongly recommended initial clinical fracture risk assessment including symptomatic and asymptomatic fracture history, FRAX (age ≥40 only), and BMD with VFA or spine x-rays over no assessment (PICO 8.1-8.4). These strong recommendations are based on good clinical practice and the need for clinicians to risk stratify patients beginning or continuing GC therapy, despite the low certainty of the evidence.
