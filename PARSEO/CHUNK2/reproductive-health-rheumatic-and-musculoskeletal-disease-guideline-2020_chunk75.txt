additional treatments are needed for patients who do not respond to standard therapy. Intravenous immunoglobuin, low-dose prednisone, increased dose of heparin/LMWH, and HCQ have all been suggested as additional or alternative treatments. We conditionally recommend against treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin or an increased LMWH dose, as these have not been demonstrably helpful in cases of pregnancy loss despite standard therapy with low-dose aspirin and prophylactic heparin or LMWH.
