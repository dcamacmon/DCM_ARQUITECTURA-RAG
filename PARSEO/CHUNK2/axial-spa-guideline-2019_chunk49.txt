a spinal or pelvis MRI to assess activity (new, PICO 68). In adults with nonradiographic axial SpA of unclear activity while receiving a biologic, we conditionally recommend obtaining a pelvis MRI to assess activity (new, PICO 81). Because physical and laboratory measures are often normal despite active axial SpA, and because symptoms may be nonspecific, it may be difficult to know whether a patient is experiencing inflammation that warrants a change in treatment. Limited evidence suggests that
