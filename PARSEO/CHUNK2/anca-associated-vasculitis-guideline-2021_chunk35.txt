and values should guide selection between them, given their comparable efficacy. Recommendation: For patients with GPA/MPA who are receiving rituximab for remission maintenance, we conditionally recommend scheduled re-dosing over using ANCA titers or CD19+ B cell counts to guide re-dosing. In one randomized trial, patients who received rituximab for remission maintenance based on changes in CD19+ B cell counts and/or ANCA titers had similar rates of relapse as those receiving rituximab as a
