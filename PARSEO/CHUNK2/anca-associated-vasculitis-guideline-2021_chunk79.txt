(see ungraded position statement and recommendation on this topic). Recommendation: For patients with EGPA who have experienced relapse with nonsevere disease manifestations (asthma and/or sinonasal disease) while receiving methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil, we conditionally recommend adding mepolizumab over switching to another agent. For patients with EGPA with active asthma, inhaled therapies should be maximized prior to increasing systemic immunosuppressive therapy.
