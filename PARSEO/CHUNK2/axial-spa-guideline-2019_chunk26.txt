of recurrent infections, sulfasalazine was preferred over secukinumab, izekizumab, and tofacitinib. In these cases, efforts to mitigate the infections should be undertaken so that TNFi might safely be used. Treatment with rituximab, abatacept, ustekinumab, or IL-6 inhibitors is not recommended, even in patients with contraindications to TNFi, due to lack of effectiveness. In adults with active AS despite treatment with the first TNFi used, we conditionally recommend treatment with secukinumab
