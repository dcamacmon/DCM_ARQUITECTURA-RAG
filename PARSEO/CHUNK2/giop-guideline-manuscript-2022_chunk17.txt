in GIOP For adults ≥40 years with high or very high fracture risk, we strongly recommended oral BP A strong recommendation for oral BP is based on studies showing a reduction in total and vertebral fractures at 24 months and increased hip and lumbar spine BMD compared to calcium and vitamin D alone in GIOP (evidence report, Appendix S3, page 16). For adults ≥40 years with high fracture risk, we conditionally recommend PTH/PTHrP or DEN over BP (PICO 1.4c-1.28.c). For adults ≥40 years with high
