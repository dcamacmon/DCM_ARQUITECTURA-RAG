treatment with rituximab over switching to cyclophosphamide for remission re-induction. Re-induction of remission with rituximab is favored over cyclophosphamide treatment to minimize toxicity. However, the duration of remission prior to the onset of relapse should be examined. Cyclophosphamide should be considered if a severe relapse occurred quickly after rituximab treatment, or if cardiac involvement is present (see ungraded position statement and recommendation on this topic).
