<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This guideline provides evidence-based consensus recommendations for the optimal timing of hip and knee arthroplasty on patient important outcomes including, but not limited to, pain, function, infection, hospitalization, and death at one year, for a target population of people with symptomatic, radiographic moderate to severe osteoarthritis (OA) or osteonecrosis (ON) of the hip and knee who have previously attempted nonoperative treatment and chosen to undergo elective hip or knee arthroplasty (collectively referred to as TJA). This guideline follows the ACR guideline development process, which includes the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology, and adheres to the Appraisal of Guidelines for REsearch &amp; Evaluation (AGREE) criteria. A panel of rheumatologists, orthopaedic surgeons, and patients performed a systematic literature review for clinically relevant population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes (PICO) questions, and reached consensus on the following recommendations, taking into consideration available evidence, clinical experience and expertise, and patient values and preferences. Evidence for all recommendations was graded as low or very low quality, primarily due to indirectness. Key messages:</p><p>1. The panel recommended that the decision of when to proceed with TJA should be made through a shared decision-making process between the physician and patient during which the unique risks and benefits for the individual patient are considered (guiding principle).</p><p>2. The panel conditionally recommended the following: a. Do not delay TJA to pursue additional nonoperative treatment including physical therapy, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, ambulatory aids, and injections.</p></div>

Delay TJA to improve glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus, but we do not recommend a specific measure or threshold based on our literature review. d. Obesity by itself is not a reason for delaying surgery. There should be no inflexible weight or BMI target requirement for surgery, but weight loss should be strongly encouraged.</p><p>e. Do not delay surgery in patients with severe deformity, bone loss, or in patients with a neuropathic joint.</p><p>Recommendation for patients with radiographically moderate to severe OA or ON of the hip or knee using standard radiographic grading such as Kellgren-Lawrence or Tonnis, and moderate to severe pain or loss of function who have been indicated for elective TJA through a shared decision-making process with their physician and have completed one or more trials of appropriate nonoperative therapy</p></div>
