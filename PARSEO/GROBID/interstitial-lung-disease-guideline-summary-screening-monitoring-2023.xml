<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>This guideline was developed to provide recommendations for the screening of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) in people with Systemic Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases (SARDs) [Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Systemic Sclerosis (SSc), Idiopathic Inflammatory Myositis (IIM including polymyositis, dermatomyositis, antisynthetase syndrome, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy), Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD), and Sj√∂gren's Disease (SjD)] associated with the greatest risk of ILD, and for monitoring for ILD progression. These recommendations facilitate rheumatologists' identification of ILD among people with SARDs and will assist in optimizing the co-management of people with SARDs-associated ILD by rheumatologists and pulmonologists.</p><p>Note. Frequency of monitoring in italics are suggestions to assist application of the recommendations.</p></div>
