<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Objective: To provide evidence-based recommendations on the use of vaccinations in children and adults with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs).</p><p>Methods: This guideline follows the ACR guideline development process and ACR policy guiding management of conflicts of interest and disclosures, which includes the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) methodology, and adheres to the Appraisal of Guidelines for REsearch &amp; Evaluation (AGREE) criteria. A core leadership team consisting of adult and pediatric rheumatologists drafted clinical population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes (PICO) questions. A literature review team performed a systematic literature review for the PICO questions, graded the quality of evidence, and produced the evidence report. The evidence was reviewed, and recommendations were formulated by an expert Voting Panel that included adult and pediatric rheumatology providers, infectious diseases specialists, and patient representatives. Consensus required ≥70% agreement on both the direction and strength of each recommendation.</p><p>Results: This guideline includes expanded indications for some vaccines in patients with RMDs, as well as guidance on whether to hold immunosuppressive medications or delay vaccination to maximize vaccine immunogenicity. Safe approaches to the use of live-attenuated vaccines in patients on immunosuppressive medications are also addressed. The overall quality of the evidence supporting the recommendations is low, and most recommendations are conditional.</p></div>

In some situations, such as during a measles outbreak, earlier vaccination would be preferred over delay. </p></div>
