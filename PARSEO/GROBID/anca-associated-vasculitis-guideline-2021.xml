<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) comprise granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). These diseases affect smalland medium-sized vessels and are characterized by multisystem organ involvement.</p><p>GPA is characterized histologically by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation in addition to vasculitis. Common clinical manifestations include destructive sinonasal lesions, pulmonary nodules, and pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. GPA is most commonly associated with cytoplasmic ANCA and antibodies to proteinase 3 (PR3). Among European populations, prevalence ranges from 24 to 157 cases per million, with the highest prevalence reported in Sweden and the UK <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</p><p>MPA is characterized histologically by vasculitis without granulomatous inflammation. Common clinical manifestations include rapidly progressive pauci-immune glomerulonephritis and alveolar hemorrhage. MPA is most commonly associated with perinuclear ANCA and antibodies to myeloperoxidase. The prevalence of MPA ranges from 0 to 66 cases per million among European countries and 86 cases per million in Japan <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2)</ref>.</p><p>EGPA is characterized histologically by eosinophilic tissue infiltration in addition to vasculitis. Common clinical manifestations include asthma, peripheral eosinophilia, and peripheral neuropathy. Only 40% of patients produce detectable ANCA. The overall prevalence of EGPA in European populations has been estimated to range from 2 to 38 cases per million <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref>.</p><p>Prior to the use of alkylating agents, survival with these diseases was quite poor (e.g., median survival of patients with GPA was ~5 months) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. Current treatment regimens have reversed this poor prognosis, but treatments are still associated with toxicity. Recent clinical trials have investigated the efficacy and toxicity of both biologic and nonbiologic immunosuppressive agents for the treatment of AAV. Observational studies have provided additional insight regarding management strategies for these diseases. Therefore, this guideline was developed to provide evidence-based recommendations for the treatment and management of GPA, MPA, and EGPA. Although this guideline may inform an international audience, these recommendations were developed considering the experience with and availability of treatment and diagnostic comparators, and outcomes (PICO). An in-person Patient Panel of 11 individuals with different types of vasculitis (4 patients with GPA, 1 patient with MPA, and 2 patients with EGPA) was moderated by a member of the Literature Review team (ABD). This Patient Panel reviewed the evidence report (along with a summary and interpretation by the moderator) and provided patient perspectives and preferences. The Voting Panel comprised 9 adult rheumatologists, 5 pediatric rheumatologists, and 2 patients; they reviewed the Literature Review team's evidence summaries and, bearing in mind the Patient Panel's deliberations, formulated and voted on recommendations.</p><p>The Voting Panel was assembled for the ACR and Vasculitis Foundation's broad effort to develop recommendations for 7 forms of systemic vasculitis: giant cell arteritis, Takayasu arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, Kawasaki syndrome, and the 3 AAVs presented in this report. The physicians on this panel included rheumatologists who could provide insight on all of these diseases and did not include other subspecialists who would not have experience with many of the other vasculitides addressed in this effort (e.g., pulmonologists who would not have experience with large-or medium-sized vessel vasculitis).</p><p>The Literature Review team chair was a nephrologist. The patients on the Voting Panel presented the views of the Patient Panel, which consisted of patients with different types of vasculitis. A recommendation required ≥70% consensus among the Voting Panel.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>How to interpret the recommendations</head><p>A strong recommendation is usually supported by moderateto high-quality evidence (e.g., multiple randomized controlled trials). For a strong recommendation, the recommended course of action would apply to all or almost all patients. Only a small proportion of clinicians/patients would not want to follow the recommendation. In rare instances, a strong recommendation may be based on very low-to low-certainty evidence. For example, an intervention may be strongly recommended if it is considered benign, lowcost, without harms, and the consequence of not performing the intervention may be catastrophic. An intervention may be strongly recommended against if there is high certainty that the intervention leads to more harm than the comparison with very low or low certainty about its benefit <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>. | 1091</p><p>A conditional recommendation is usually supported by lower-quality evidence or a close balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes. For a conditional recommendation, the recommended course of action would apply to the majority of the patients, but the alternative is a reasonable consideration. Conditional recommendations always warrant a shared decisionmaking approach. We specify some conditions under which the alternative may be considered.</p><p>In some instances, the committee found that the evidence for a particular PICO question did not support a graded recommendation or did not favor one intervention over the other. However, the Voting Panel believed that the PICO question addressed a commonly encountered clinical question and thus felt that providing guidance for this question was warranted. For these situations, we present "ungraded position statements," which reflect general views of the Voting Panel.</p><p>In this evidence-based guideline, we explicitly used the best evidence available and present it for the clinician and reader <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>. In some instances, this includes randomized trials in which the interventions under consideration are directly compared. The GRADE system rates evidence that comes exclusively from the collective experience of the Voting Panel and Patient Panel members as "very low quality" evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>.</p><p>For each recommendation, details regarding the PICO questions and the GRADE evidence tables can be found in Supplementary Appendix 2 (<ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24634/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10. 1002/acr.24634/ abstract</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RESULTS</head><p>For the evidence report for GPA and MPA, the Literature Review team reviewed 729 articles to address 47 PICO questions. For the evidence report for EGPA, 190 articles were reviewed to address 34 PICO questions.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Recommendations and ungraded position statements for GPA and MPA</head><p>GPA and MPA are recognized as different diseases for which disease-specific management approaches exist. However, many recommendations and ungraded position statements consider GPA and MPA together, because pivotal trials have enrolled both groups and presented results for these diseases together. Therefore, we present recommendations and ungraded position statements applicable to both GPA and MPA as well as recommendations and ungraded position statements only applicable to GPA. All recommendations for GPA/MPA are conditional, due in part to a lack of multiple randomized controlled trials supporting the recommendations. The complete list of studies reviewed to form the recommendations is provided in the evidence report (Supplementary Appendix 2, <ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24634/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/ 10. 1002/ acr.24634/ abstract</ref>). Given that these diseases affect multiple organ systems, collaboration between rheumatologists, ne phrologists, pulmonologists, and otolaryngologists can enhance the care of patients with GPA and MPA.</p><p>Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> presents the definitions of selected terms used in the recommendations and ungraded position statements, including the definition of severe and nonsevere disease and the dosing regimens of medications used for remission induction and maintenance. Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref> presents the recommendations and ungraded position statements with their supporting PICO questions and levels of evidence. Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> presents key recommendations for the treatment of GPA and MPA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remission induction for active, severe disease</head><p>Recommendation: For patients with active, severe GPA/MPA, we conditionally recommend treatment with rituximab over cyclophosphamide for remission induction.</p><p>Both rituximab and cyclophosphamide, in combination with glucocorticoids, have been used for remission induction in GPA and MPA. Rituximab has been shown to provide similar benefits to cyclophosphamide for remission induction in a randomized controlled trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(9)</ref>. Although the currently used cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide are lower than previous regimens and result in less toxicity per treatment course, rituximab is still preferred, since rituximab is considered less toxic than cyclophosphamide. A single course of cyclophosphamide can carry substantial risks such as neutropenia, bladder injury, and the small but present potential for infertility which can be devastating to a young patient. Risks of malignancy and infertility increase when repeated courses of cyclophosphamide are used. Rituximab was also preferred by the Patient Panel, as a generally better-tolerated treatment. Retrospective studies suggest that the 2 remission induction regimens for rituximab used in adults (375 mg/m 2 every week for 4 weeks [US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved dosing schedule] and 1,000 mg on days 1 and 15) are equally efficacious. The choice between these regimens should be guided by the patient's preferences and values.</p><p>Cyclophosphamide (dosing provided in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) may be used when rituximab needs to be avoided or when patients have active disease despite receiving rituximab treatment. It remains controversial whether cyclophosphamide should be preferred for certain types of severe disease, such as acute renal failure (e.g., serum creatinine &gt;4.0 mg/dl). Either intravenous (IV) pulse or daily oral cyclophosphamide can be used <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11)</ref>. For adults, the decision between these 2 options should be based on patient and physician preferences. In children, IV cyclophosphamide may be preferred to facilitate compliance and limit toxicity. Data regarding the efficacy of combined cyclophosphamide and rituximab therapy for remission induction remain limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12)</ref>, and potential toxicity of this combination remains a concern. The combination of rituximab with cyclophosphamide is not widely used in the US, and its efficacy compared to rituximab | 1093 or cyclophosphamide monotherapy is not established. This combination remains under study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03942887) at this time.</p><p>Recommendation: In patients with GPA/MPA with active glomerulonephritis, we conditionally recommend against the routine addition of plasma exchange to remission induction therapy.</p><p>Plasma exchange should not be initiated in all patients with active glomerulonephritis but can be considered for patients at higher risk of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who accept a potential increased risk of infection.</p><p>This recommendation is supported by data from the 2 largest trials of plasma exchange for the treatment of glomerulonephritis in AAV. The first trial, which required a serum creatinine level of ≥5.8 mg/ dl for entry, showed that plasma exchange decreased the risk of ESRD but did not decrease mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14)</ref>. In a more recent randomized trial of plasma exchange in AAV, the addition of plasma exchange to conventional remission induction therapy did not improve the composite outcome of ESRD or death; a decrease in the risk of ESRD was observed, but the result was not statistically significant (hazard ratio 0.81 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.57-1.13]) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(15)</ref>.</p><p>However, combined data from these 2 trials show that there is probably a decreased risk of ESRD in patients with glomerulonephritis who received plasma exchange, compared to those who did not (hazard ratio 0.72 [95% CI 0.53-0.98]; moderate certainty) (Supplementary Appendix 2, <ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24634/abstract">http://onlin e libr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24634/ abstract</ref>). The benefit was most pronounced in patients with the highest risk of ESRD (118 fewer cases of ESRD per 1,000 cases of active glomerulonephritis [95% CI between 217 and 7 fewer cases]), although no difference in mortality was demonstrated (risk ratio 1.15 [95% CI 0.78-1.70]; moderate certainty). In 4 trials of plasma exchange in AAV, a higher risk of severe infection was observed with plasma exchange (risk ratio 1.19 [95% CI 0.99-1.42]; moderate certainty).</p><p>These findings suggest that for patients with a low risk of progression to ESRD, the risk of plasma exchange may outweigh the benefit; however, in patients with a higher risk of progression to ESRD, the decrease in risk could outweigh the increased risk of serious infection with plasma exchange. Therefore, the Voting Panel does not recommend plasma exchange for all patients with active glomerulonephritis but favors consideration of the treatment for patients at a higher risk of progression to ESRD. Factors that could influence whether plasma exchange is initiated include the patient's kidney function upon presentation, rate of loss of kidney function, response to remission induction therapies, and the patient's ability to tolerate serious infections.</p></div>

Thus, plasma exchange does not have an established benefit for patients with alveolar hemorrhage and is associated with an increased risk of serious infection (see above recommendation). Plasma exchange may be considered for certain patients with active glomerulonephritis or those who are critically ill and whose disease is not responding to recommended remission induction therapies (i.e., plasma exchange as "salvage" or "rescue" therapy).</p><p>Plasma exchange remains advisable in patients with GPA or MPA who also have anti-glomerular basement membrane disease.</p><p>Ungraded position statement: For patients with active, severe GPA/MPA, either IV pulse glucocorticoids or high-dose oral glucocorticoids may be prescribed as part of initial therapy.</p><p>There are no trials comparing the efficacy of IV pulse glucocorticoids to high-dose oral glucocorticoids.

Due to the known toxicities associated with long-term glucocorticoid use, minimizing glucocorticoid exposure is critical to improving outcomes. Glucocorticoid dosing may be individualized for each patient. Of note, the reduced-dose regimen started with pulse methylprednisolone (3 daily pulses for maximum total dose of 3 gm) and 1 week of high-dose oral glucocorticoids. The dosing regimens used in this study are described in Supplementary Appendix 3 (<ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24634/abstract">http://onlin e libr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24634/ abstract</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remission induction for active, nonsevere disease</head><p>Recommendation: For patients with active, nonsevere GPA, we conditionally recommend initiating treatment with methotrexate over cyclophosphamide or rituximab.</p><p>Nonsevere GPA is defined as GPA without life-or organthreatening manifestations (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>). Methotrexate, rituximab, and cyclophosphamide are effective at inducing remission in this patient | 1095 group <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>. However, like severe GPA, nonsevere GPA can be a chronic disease that requires multiple courses of therapy. Thus, the Voting Panel favored using therapies with potentially less toxicity before utilizing therapies with potentially more toxicity. Therefore, methotrexate is preferred due to the greater toxicity of cyclophosphamide. Methotrexate is currently recommended over rituximab because of the larger body of evidence and clinical experience with methotrexate treatment for this patient group; clinical trials are needed to compare their efficacy.

Azathioprine is the preferred agent for pregnant patients or in patients who cannot tolerate methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil, while methotrexate or mycophenolate mofetil is indicated in patients with total thiopurine S-methyltransferase deficiency or high-risk TPMT and/or NUDT15 genotypes.</p><p>Recommendation: For patients with active, nonsevere GPA, we conditionally recommend initiating treatment with methotrexate and glucocorticoids over trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole and glucocorticoids.</p><p>Methotrexate is considered more effective than trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for remission induction, based on previous findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(17)</ref>.

However, asthma and allergic manifestations are a significant component of EGPA, and measures directed toward these, including inhaled therapies and allergen avoidance, play an important role in management.

Increasing experience with rituximab in GPA/MPA has also led to more patients with EGPA being treated with rituximab, and case series suggest that rituximab may also have efficacy for active, severe disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(44)</ref>. Given that the comparative effectiveness of cyclophosphamide and rituximab for EGPA is unknown, the Voting Panel felt that both cyclophosphamide and rituximab could be considered for remission induction in active, severe EGPA.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Remission induction for active, nonsevere disease</head><p>Recommendation: For patients with active, nonsevere EGPA, we conditionally recommend initiating treatment with mepolizumab and glucocorticoids over methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids.</p><p>A range of immunosuppressive agents may be considered in the treatment of active, nonsevere EGPA, all of which are used with glucocorticoids. The clinical profile of nonsevere EGPA includes predominantly asthma, sinus disease, and nonsevere vasculitis. While there is significant clinical experience with methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil, there are limited data regarding their efficacy, and these treatments have not been assessed in randomized clinical trials. The GRADE methodology used in the guideline development process weights clinical trials more heavily than observational studies. Thus, mepolizumab is recommended as the first choice, because it has been found to be efficacious for nonsevere EGPA in a randomized trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(45)</ref>. All patients in this trial had relapsing or refractory disease, with 55% receiving an additional nonglucocorticoid immunosuppressive agent at the time of enrollment. A large proportion of patients in this trial had asthmatic and eosinophilic features, for which mepolizumab has also been found to be effective in non-EGPA disease settings. Although patients with nonsevere vasculitic manifestations were represented in this trial, questions remain about the effectiveness of mepolizumab for all aspects of nonsevere vasculitis. Individual factors, including disease manifestations, may impact the decision to use mepolizumab, in which case methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil may be used instead. There are insufficient data to favor one of these medications (methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil) over the others; therefore, the choice should be influenced by individual patient factors.</p><p>Recommendation: For patients with active, nonsevere EGPA, we conditionally recommend initiating treatment with methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids over glucocorticoids alone.</p><p>Patients should be treated with adjunctive methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil rather than glucocorticoids alone in order to minimize glucocorticoid toxicity. One randomized trial that combined patients with EGPA, MPA, and polyarteritis nodosa without poor prognosis factors showed that the addition of azathioprine did not provide benefit beyond glucocorticoids alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(46)</ref>. Particularly for patients with asthma, this may impact the decision to use methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil concurrently with glucocorticoids and could lead to consideration of mepolizumab.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Other considerations</head><p>Recommendation: For patients with newly diagnosed EGPA receiving leukotriene inhibitors, we conditionally recommend continuing leukotriene inhibitors over discontinuing them.</p><p>Following the introduction of leukotriene inhibitors, concerns were raised about a link with the development of EGPA. In subsequent retrospective studies, it was not concluded that there is a causal relationship between leukotriene inhibitors and EGPA <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(52)</ref>. Therefore, patients with newly diagnosed EGPA should have the option to continue a leukotriene inhibitor if it is beneficial in the management of their asthma or sinonasal disease.</p><p>Ungraded position statement: Use of leukotriene inhibitors is not contraindicated for patients with EGPA with active asthma and/or sinonasal disease.</p><p>Leukotriene inhibitors carry therapeutic indications for asthma and allergic rhinitis. As no clear causal association with EGPA has been demonstrated, a leukotriene inhibitor can be added to help manage asthma and sinonasal disease. However, leukotriene inhibitors are one of many options and are not the only choice in this setting. Leukotriene inhibitors should not be used to treat manifestations aside from asthma and sinonasal disease.</p><p>Recommendation: For patients with EGPA, we conditionally recommend obtaining an echocardiogram at the time of diagnosis.</p><p>Cardiac involvement is the major cause of diseaserelated mortality in EGPA <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(48)</ref>. Echocardiography has minimal risk and can identify cardiac involvement, which, if present, can impact treatment decisions. Not identifying cardiac involvement could negatively impact patient outcomes. Thus, we recommend obtaining an echocardiogram for all patients with newly diagnosed EGPA, even in the absence of cardiac symptoms.</p><p>Recommendation: For patients with EGPA, we conditionally recommend using the Five-Factor Score to guide therapy.</p><p>The Five-Factor Score (FFS), first published in 1996 <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(53)</ref>, was based on a cohort of 342 patients with either polyarteritis nodosa, as it was then defined, or EGPA. These 5 factors include proteinuria &gt;1 gm/day, renal insufficiency with serum creatinine &gt;1.58 mg/ dl, gastrointestinal tract involvement, cardiomyopathy, and central nervous system involvement. The FFS is primarily a prognostic tool for which higher scores have been associated with a worse outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">(53)</ref>. It has been used to guide treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(43)</ref>, but its applicability to newer therapies is unknown. The FFS was revisited in 2011 in a population of 1,108 patients with GPA, MPA, EGPA, or PAN <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(54)</ref>. The 2011 version included ear, nose, and throat parameters and age &gt;65 years. The 1996 FFS remains more commonly used and may be helpful in identifying organ-specific parameters associated with severe disease and in guiding treatment. Although the definitions of severe and nonsevere EGPA used in the present guideline were not based on the FFS, the tool was found to be useful to clinicians for making treatment decisions. The components of the FFS can serve as markers of severe disease that warrant more aggressive treatment.</p><p>Ungraded position statement: In patients with sinonasal involvement in EGPA, treatment with nasal rinses and topical therapies (e.g., antibiotics, lubricants, and glucocorticoids) may be considered.</p><p>Allergic rhinitis and sinonasal disease are frequent clinical features of EGPA. Although the efficacy of nasal rinses and topical | 1103 therapies in EGPA is not well established, some patients may benefit. Where possible, consultation with an otolaryngologist with expertise in treating AAV should be obtained to guide the use and choice of these agents. These interventions can continue to be beneficial even when symptoms have improved or resolved.</p><p>Recommendation: For patients with EGPA who are receiving cyclophosphamide or rituximab, we conditionally recommend prescribing medications for prophylaxis to prevent P jirovecii pneumonia.</p><p>Prophylaxis to prevent P jirovecii pneumonia is discussed above in the GPA/MPA recommendations. The same considerations regarding prophylaxis to prevent this condition in patients with GPA/MPA apply to those with EGPA.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>In this guideline, we present the first ACR/Vasculitis Foundation recommendations for the management of GPA, MPA, and EGPA. Although these recommendations provide a general guide for disease management, the patient's clinical condition, preferences, and values should influence their treatment. Overall, these recommendations reflect the evolving management of these diseases, including the new roles for biologic therapies and aggressive strategies to minimize glucocorticoid toxicity. The recommendations for GPA and MPA are supported by a greater number of randomized trials than are currently available in EGPA. All of the recommendations made for these 3 diseases are conditional, which indicates that there are settings in which the evidence is not strong or an alternative is a reasonable consideration. These recommendations should not be used by any agency to restrict access to therapy or require that certain therapies be utilized prior to other therapies.</p><p>The physicians on the Voting Panel were primarily rheumatologists, because the recommendations were being developed for rheumatologists in the US. Since AAVs are multisystem diseases, patients with AAVs often receive care from other medical subspecialists (e.g., nephrologists, pulmonologists, and/or otolaryngologists). While the recommendations presented in this guideline are driven by the published data, other medical subspecialists may favor a different management strategy. We encourage rheumatologists to discuss treatment plans and coordinate care with other subspecialists as needed.</p><p>Recently, a clinical trial of avacopan in patients with GPA and MPA was published <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(55)</ref>. This guideline development effort did not include consideration of avacopan, since the guidelines consider therapies that are approved by the FDA for use for any indication at the time of the last literature search. Therapies approved by the FDA after that date will be considered for inclusion in future updates to this guideline.</p><p>This guideline highlights gaps in our knowledge for the treatment of AAV. Most glaring is the lack of biomarker assessments or other noninvasive diagnostic testing with minimal toxicity that can accurately assess disease activity and predict outcomes. In addition, while we have evidence from randomized clinical trials to support recommendations regarding initial remission induction and maintenance therapy, critical questions remain unanswered, such as the optimal duration of therapy.</p><p>These gaps in knowledge reinforce the need for ongoing research in these diseases. Specific areas to investigate include the following: 1) biomarker studies to identify more specific, reliable indicators of disease activity that can guide treatment decisions; 2) trials to clarify how best to use the currently available medications (e.g., dosing, duration, effective combinations, and in which population to use which drugs); 3) trials to identify novel, targeted, and/or glucocorticoid-sparing agents with minimal toxicity; and 4) long-term studies to understand the course of disease and the safety of current therapies.</p><p>We hope significant progress will be made in these areas such that future recommendations provide a more tailored approach to disease management, minimize treatment toxicity, and prevent organ damage in these patients.</p><p>Seo, Stone, Vitobaldi, Warner, Byram, Dua, Husainat, Kalot, Lin, Springer, Turgunbaev, Mustafa.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>*</head><label></label><figDesc>For the population, intervention, comparator, and outcome (PICO) questions used in the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology, as developed for granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), please refer to Supplementary Appendix 2 (available on the Arthritis Care &amp; Research website at http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24634/ abstract).
