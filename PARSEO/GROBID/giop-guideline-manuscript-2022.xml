The objective is to update recommendations for prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) for patients with rheumatic or nonrheumatic conditions receiving &gt;3 months treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs) ≥2.5 mg daily.</p><p>Methods. An updated systematic literature review was performed for clinical questions on nonpharmacologic, pharmacologic treatments, discontinuation of medications, and sequential therapy.

For adults at medium, high, or very high fracture risk, we strongly recommend pharmacologic treatment. Choice of oral or intravenous bisphosphonates, denosumab, or parathyroid hormone analogs should be made by shared decision-making.

Guidelines and recommendations are intended to promote beneficial or desirable outcomes but cannot guarantee any specific outcome. Guidelines and recommendations developed and endorsed by the ACR are subject to periodic revision as warranted by the evolution of medical knowledge, technology, and practice.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>Glucocorticoids (GCs) remain a common therapeutic modality for patients with a variety of diseases. Prevention of GC-induced bone loss and fractures has been a focus of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) for many years because patients with osteoporotic fractures have increased risk of morbidity and mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>. It is estimated that 1% of the US population is treated with long-term GCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>. GC doses ≥2.5 mg/day increase fracture at both the spine and hip, and GC &lt;2.5 mg/day increase the risk of spinal fractures <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref>. Both high daily (≥30 mg/day) and high cumulative (≥5 g/year) doses of GCs further increase the risk of fragility fractures, with peak incidence at 12 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>. The highest rate of bone loss occurs within the first 3 to 6 months of GC treatment, due to early osteoclast activation followed by decreased osteoblast proliferation and increased apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref>. In children, GCs adversely affect bone strength, growth, and peak bone mass, with increased fracture risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>. However, children <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> and young adults often regain lost bone when GCs are discontinued <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</p><p>Despite increasing treatment options to prevent and treat glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP), many GC-treated patients are not evaluated or treated, resulting in preventable fractures <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19)</ref>. Risk calculators provide estimates of the 10-year risk of major osteoporotic fractures (MOFs) and hip fractures among individuals ≥40 years of age, with adjustment for GC doses &gt;7.5 mg/day or &lt;2.5 mg/day in some calculators <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22)</ref>. Of note, the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) is not validated for adults &lt;40 years. These calculators underestimate fracture risk for patients on very high doses of GC therapy (eg, ≥ 30 mg/day) and do not adequately include frailty, multiple fractures, or fall history.</p><p>The ACR first published recommendations for prevention and treatment of GIOP in 1996 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref>. ACR updated these guidelines in 2001, 2010, and 2017 as new techniques for assessing fracture risk, risk factors, and therapies became available <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(23)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(24)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>. This guideline updated the literature search from April 23, 2016, through January 24, 2022, and it includes two medications newly US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for OP treatment since the 2017 guideline.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>METHODS</head><p>This guideline follows the ACR guideline development process and ACR policy guiding management of conflicts of interest and disclosures (<ref type="url" target="https://www.rheumatology.org/Practice-Quality/Clinical-Support/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines">https://www.rheumatology.org/Practice-Quality/Clinical-Support/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines</ref>), including use of Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28)</ref> and adherence to Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) criteria <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(29)</ref>. Supplementary Appendix 1, available on the Arthritis Care &amp; Research website at <ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/</ref> doi/10.1002/acr.25240/abstract, includes a detailed description of the methods. Briefly, the Core Leadership Team (MBH, LR, MID, HAF, GG, SU) reviewed the 2017 ACR GIOP guideline clinical Patient/Intervention/Comparator/Outcomes (PICO) questions, modified and drafted new PICO questions in topic areas not covered previously (eg, abaloparatide, romosozumab, combination and sequential therapy) (see Supplementary Appendix 2, <ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25240/abstract">http:// onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25240/abstract</ref>). The Literature Review Team updated the systematic literature reviews for each of the previous PICO questions and/or performed new ones for new questions, graded the quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, very low), and produced the evidence report (see Supplementary Appendix 3, <ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/</ref> acr.25240/abstract). The resulting evidence was reviewed, and recommendations were formulated and voted on by an expert Voting Panel. A virtual Patient Panel of three patients with GIOP and one parent of a child treated with GCs reviewed the evidence with a co-principal investigator (LR) and provided patient perspectives and preferences for consideration by the Voting Panel. Voting Panel consensus required ≥70% agreement on both direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation. Rosters of the Core Leadership Team, </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>RECOMMENDATIONS How to interpret the recommendations</head><p>According to GRADE, a strong recommendation is usually supported by moderate-to high-certainty evidence, including randomized control trials, the recommended course of action would apply to all or almost all patients, and there is high confidence that the benefits of the intervention clearly outweigh the harms (or vice versa). In rare instances, a strong recommendation or best practices may be made with very-low certainty evidence if the recommendation is considered benign, low cost, and without harms.</p><p>A conditional recommendation is supported by lower certainty evidence, has uncertainty regarding the balance of benefits and harms, is sensitive to individual patient preferences, or has costs expected to impact the decision. Thus, conditional recommendations warrant shared decisionmaking with the patient. Notably, most evidence reviewed in this guideline is downgraded for indirectness because 1) identified studies in GIOP rely on a surrogate fracture risk marker, bone mineral density (BMD), because they were not powered for fracture outcomes and 2) available fracture data were exclusively or predominantly from general osteoporosis (OP) studies. Recommendations for fracture risk assessment (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>)</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Key recommendations</head><p>For all adults (≥18 years old) initiating or continuing GC therapy ≥2.5 mg/day for &gt;3 months, we strongly recommended initial clinical fracture risk assessment including symptomatic and asymptomatic fracture history, FRAX (age ≥40 only), and BMD with VFA or spine x-rays over no assessment (PICO 8.1-8.4).</p><p>These strong recommendations are based on good clinical practice and the need for clinicians to risk stratify patients beginning or continuing GC therapy, despite the low certainty of the evidence. Initial assessment should occur as soon as possible within 6 months of GC therapy initiation. Clinical fracture risk assessment includes dose, duration, and pattern of GC use, alcohol use, smoking history, hypogonadism, history of prior fractures (traumatic, fragility, asymptomatic), low body weight, significant weight loss, parental history of hip fracture, fall history, thyroid disease, hyperparathyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, malabsorption, chronic liver disease, and inflammatory bowel disease (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). BMD with VFA or spinal x-rays are strongly recommended, and, for adults ≥40 years old, FRAX analysis is also recommended. (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>). If prednisone dose is &gt;7.5 mg daily, FRAX GC correction is recommended (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>; however, even this adjustment may not correct for very high doses of GC (≥30 mg/day) <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(30)</ref>. Additionally, FRAX does not incorporate falls, number or timing of fractures, or frailty that may put a person at higher risk of fracture. BMD assessment provides a strong predictor of fracture risk and serves as a baseline for reassessment because FRAX analysis is not validated for fracture risk reassessment during OP therapy. Trabecular bone score (TBS) provides a more sensitive measure of therapeutic responses to OP treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(31)</ref>. BMD measurement is strongly recommended for patients &lt;40 years on GCs ≥2.5 mg/day with one or more osteoporotic risk factors. In this age group, z-scores ≤ -2.0 indicates low bone mass for age. Unlike t-scores, z-scores do not provide an estimate of fracture risk because adults &lt;40 years have low fracture risk at baseline. This guideline did not include specific PICO questions concerning DXA or spinal imaging in children beginning or continuing chronic GC therapy, but the Voting Panel discussed this population. Despite uncertainty about initial DXA or screening spine radiographs, we recommend spine x-ray in children with back pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>. However, the totality of a child's clinical presentation We strongly recommend OP treatment for those at moderate, high, or very high risk of fracture. We strongly recommend oral BP over no treatment in high and very high fracture risk due to fracture reduction in GIOP. We conditionally recommend IV BP, ROM, RAL over no treatment in high and very high risk of fracture. In moderate risk, we conditionally recommend BP, DEN, or PTH/PTHrP in no preferred order among these agents.</p><p>We conditionally recommend treatment for those at moderate or very high risk of fracture with oral or IV BP, ‡ PTH/PTHrP, § or DEN §# PTH/PTHrP Agonists (TER, ABL, Anti-RANKL, DEN)</p><p>We conditionally recommend PTH/PTHrP over antiresorptives in patients at very high risk of fracture. We conditionally recommend DEN §# or PTH/PTHrP over oral and IV BP in high risk of fracture. In moderate risk, we conditionally recommend BP, DEN, or PTH/PTHrP in no preferred order among these agents.</p><p>-</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Selective estrogen receptor modifier (RAL), Antisclerostin (ROM)</head><p>We conditionally recommend IV BP, ROM, RAL over no treatment in high and very high risk of fracture.</p><p>Except in patients intolerant of other agents, we conditionally recommend against RAL due to harms of VTE and fatal stroke or ROM due to uncertain harms with increased myocardial infarction, stroke and death.</p><p>We conditionally recommended against RAL due to harms of VTE and fatal stroke or ROM due to uncertain harms including increased myocardial infarction, stroke and death (eg, age at diagnosis, growth, body mass index [BMI], disease severity, GC dosing, BMD, symptomatic or asymptomatic vertebral compression fractures) should be taken into account when considering assessment for OP therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref>.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">*</formula><p>As in prior guidelines, we used risk categories of low, moderate, and high using DXA and/or FRAX assessments (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref> Recommendations for reassessment of fracture risk (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ref>)</p><p>For adults continuing chronic GC ≥2.5 mg/day but &lt;7.5 mg/day and assessed as low fracture risk, who were not recommended to start therapy, or moderate fracture risk who chose not to start OP therapy (except calcium and vitamin D), we strongly recommend fracture risk reassessment every 1 to 2 years (PICO 9.1-9.4).</p><p>Despite the low certainty of the evidence, this is a strong recommendation as good clinical practice. Fracture risk reassessment includes clinical fracture risk history, new symptomatic fractures, FRAX, BMD, VFA, and/or spine x-rays. Repeating DXA assessment every 1 to 2 years allows providers to detect the least significant BMD change according to their DXA machine, triggering the need to start OP therapy.</p><p>For adults continuing chronic GC ≥2.5 mg/day and assessed as moderate, high, or very high fracture risk who are continuing OP therapy ≥1 year, we strongly recommend fracture risk re-assessment every 1 to 2 years over no risk reassessment (PICO 9.5-9.12).</p><p>Despite the low certainty of the evidence, this is a strong recommendation as good clinical practice. Reassessment allows providers to determine if patients continuing GC and OP therapy are maintaining, gaining, or losing BMD, warranting possible changes in OP therapy. Yearly BMD assessment until a stable BMD is reached may be preferred in very high fracture risk patients.</p><p>For adults stopping GC and remaining at moderate, high, or very high fracture risk, we strongly recommend continuing OP therapy (PICO 12.1-12.6).  Recommendations for initial treatment (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ref>, Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ref>) For all adults and children beginning or continuing chronic GC at a dose of ≥2.5 mg/day for &gt;3 months, we conditionally recommended optimizing age appropriate dietary and supplemental calcium and vitamin D, in addition to lifestyle modifications (PICO 1.1-1. The evidence for calcium and vitamin D supplementation for fracture reduction in GIOP is low to very low. Dietary and supplemented elemental calcium intake of up to 1,000 to 1,200 mg daily is recommended for adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref> and between 1,000 and For adults ≥40 years with high or very high fracture risk, we strongly recommended treatment with OP therapy over treatment with calcium and vitamin D alone (PICO 1).</p><p>For adults ≥40 years with very high fracture risk, we conditionally recommend PTH/PTHrP over anti-resorptives (BP or DEN) (PICO 1.13c, 1.14c, 1.15c, 1.18c, 1.19c, 1.20c).</p><p>Compared to alendronate, teriparatide increased lumbar and hip BMD and decreased vertebral but not nonvertebral fractures at 36 months in GIOP <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38)</ref>. Bone anabolic effect is blunted when treatment follows anti-resorptive therapy.</p><p>For adults ≥40 years with high or very high fracture risk, we strongly recommended oral BP <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> over no treatment (PICO 1).</p><p>A strong recommendation for oral BP is based on studies showing a reduction in total and vertebral fractures at 24 months and increased hip and lumbar spine BMD compared to calcium and vitamin D alone in GIOP (evidence report, Appendix S3, page 16). For adults ≥40 years with high fracture risk, we conditionally recommend PTH/PTHrP or DEN over BP (PICO 1.4c-1.28.c).</p><p>For adults ≥40 years with high fracture risk, we conditionally recommend IV or oral BP, PTH/PTHrP, or DEN over Raloxifene (RAL) or Romosozumab (ROM) (PICO 1.4c-1.28.c).</p><p>High-certainty evidence indicates that oral BP prevents vertebral fractures in GIOP <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(39)</ref> and warrants a strong recommendation for use here. Compared to oral BP, PTH is superior at increasing BMD 24 and 36 months and prevented vertebral fractures at 36 months (37). In the very high risk group, providers may recommend PTH/PTHrP as initial treatment because anabolism is blunted in patients previously treated with BP <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(40)</ref>. IV BP and DEN GIOP trials have not been powered to detect reductions of GIOP fractures and instead use a surrogate endpoint of BMD changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(42)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(43)</ref>. However, the relationship between increases in BMD and a decrease in vertebral fractures is inconsistent and may account for only 25% of overall reduction in fracture risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(44)</ref>. Evidence for fracture reduction of PTHrP, DEN, RAL, and ROM therapies have been demonstrated in general OP but not GIOP, leading to downgrading the evidence to low or very low certainty evidence. However, DEN and PTH show superior BMD gains in GIOP compared to BP and may be preferred in patients with high risk.</p><p>Compared to BP and RAL, PTH/PTHrP, DEN, and ROM require sequential therapy with an anti-resorptive agent to prevent bone losses. Discontinuation of DEN must be followed by a BP beginning at 6 to 7 months after the last DEN dose to prevent rapidly progressive vertebral fractures. Additionally, IV BP, DEN, and ROM have increased risk of atypical femur fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw compared to oral BP <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(45)</ref>. Due to RAL harms of venous thrombotic embolism events (pulmonary embolism/deep vein thrombosis [PE/DVT]) and fatal stroke and association of ROM with increased myocardial infarction, stroke, and death, these therapies should be reserved for those unable to tolerate other agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47)</ref>.

There is uncertainty concerning the cardiovascular risk, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and death related to ROM <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55)</ref>. However, until longer-term pharmacovigilance data become available, ROM should not be started in patients with a myocardial infarction or stroke within 12 months. Shared decision-making between patients and clinicians is needed to determine if benefits outweigh the risks in patients with other cardiovascular risk factors that may be untreated including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and smoking. For RAL, a meta-analysis of nine trials (24,523 postmenopausal women) found that raloxifene was associated with an increased risk of DVT and PE (odds ratio [OR] 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-2.1 and OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0-3.5, respectively) <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(56)</ref>. In the Raloxifene use for the heart (RUTH) trial, RAL were not associated with overall stroke risk but was associated with fatal stroke (59 vs 39 events, hazard ratio [HR] 1.49, 95% CI 1.0-2.2, absolute risk increase of 0.7 per 1000 woman-years) compared with placebo <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(46)</ref>.</p><p>In adults with low fracture risk, we strongly recommend against adding oral or IV BP, PTH/PTHrP, RAL, DEN, or ROM (PICO 1.4a-1.28a).</p><p>Adults &lt;40 years have low fracture risk and have significant capacity to rebuild BMD losses induced by chronic GC therapy. OP therapy should not be started in this low-risk group <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57)</ref>. This strong recommendation is based on low certainty evidence of anti-fracture benefit in this low fracture risk group, coupled with clear potential harms such as osteonecrosis of the jaw (BP, DEN, ROM), atypical femur fractures (BP, DEN, ROM), PE, DVT, and fatal stroke (RAL), myocardial infarction, stroke, and death (ROM), or requirements for sequential therapy (PTH/PTHrP, DEN, ROM).

We conditionally recommended against RAL/ROM (PICO 6.4a,b-6.24a,b).</p><p>In this younger population, PTH/ PTHrP and ROM should only be used in adults with closed growth plates. DEN should be used with caution in patients with open growth plates.</p><p>For patients who can become pregnant at moderate or high risk of fracture, we conditionally recommend treating with oral or IV BP, DEN, or PTH/PTHrP (PICO 2).</p><p>OP therapy is not contraindicated in patients who can become pregnant but should be used with effective birth control if sexually active. BP are avidly taken up by the fetal skeleton as shown in animal models and have a long half-life of BP in adult bones with unclear side effects for the fetal skeleton <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58)</ref>. Risedronate and ibandronate have shorter skeletal halflives among BP and may be preferred in this setting. DEN and PTH/PTHrP may also be used if growth plates have closed. However, DEN may cause fetal harm and is contraindicated in pregnancy. Avoid pregnancy for 5 months after the last dose of DEN.</p><p>For adults with solid organ transplants and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥35 mL/min who are continuing chronic GC treatment, we conditionally recommend treatment with BP, DEN, PTH/PTHrP, or RAL, based on individual patient factors over no treatment (PICO 5. <ref type="bibr">4-5.26)</ref>.</p><p>In this solid organ transplant population, we conditionally recommend against using ROM due to potential harms in this population (PICO 5.9, 5.21, 5.16).</p><p>This group of patients is typically considered at increased risk of fracture regardless of BMD, due to the known risk of OP associated with solid organ transplantation and anti-rejection medications. The overall certainty of evidence for treatment in this population is low, and numerous potentially influential individual patient factors need to be weighed when selecting treatment.</p><p>For adult renal transplant recipients on chronic GC treatment, we conditionally recommend metabolic bone disease expert evaluation for chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD).</p><p>In patients with stage IV and V CKD, renal osteodystrophy, including adynamic bone disease, osteomalacia, osteitis fibrosa cystica, and mixed uremic osteodystrophy, is nearly universal <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(59)</ref>. Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, intact PTH, and bone biopsy may exclude renal osteodystrophy. BP should generally not be used if eGFR &lt;35 mL/min. Once renal osteodystrophy and hyperparathyroidism is excluded, no dose adjustment is needed when prescribing DEN, PTH/PTHrP, or ROM. However, if eGFR is &lt;30 mL/min, DEN is not contraindicated but induces prolonged and more severe hypocalcemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(60)</ref>.</p><p>The panel recommended that patients without hyperparathyroidism and eGFR ≥30 mL/min could use vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) instead of biologically active forms of vitamin D (calcitriol, paricalticol, or doxercalciferol).

This conditional recommendation to treat with oral or IV BP to prevent recurrent fractures is based on low-certainty evidence. Depending on the specific disease or cause of pediatric OP, there is uncertainty about when and how to screen, and depending on the guidelines, it requires a history of clinically significant fracture(s), defined as ≥1 vertebral fractures, ≥2 long bone fractures prior to age 10 years, or ≥3 long bone fractures up to age 19 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">(61,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62)</ref>. Twelve percent of children with rheumatic conditions on chronic GC averaging doses of 0.94 ± 0.84 mg/kg/ day for 6 months who then tapered to 0.06 ± 0.12 mg/kg/day between 30 months and 36 months had vertebral fracture in the three years following GC initiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>. The same study found that every 0.5 mg/kg increase in average daily GC dose was associated with a two-fold increased fracture risk (HR 2.0, 95% CI 1.1-3.5). Other OP therapies are understudied in this young age group with open growth plates.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>DISCUSSION</head><p>The objective of this updated ACR guideline for the prevention and treatment of GIOP ( <ref type="formula">25</ref>) is to aid clinicians who prescribe GC, across all specialties, to best identify GC-treated patients who would benefit from prevention and treatment of GIOP. The overall goal is to reduce the number of fractures and their adverse consequences in this patient population, while minimizing harm due to medications. Fractures, especially hip and vertebral fractures, are associated with increased mortality, and patients frequently do not return to their baseline mobility <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74)</ref>. This guideline now addresses several new areas compared to the 2017 guideline: 1) Previously only fracture data were considered; with this guideline, both fracture reduction and BMD outcomes were considered because most GIOP studies are not powered for fracture outcomes (however, if fracture outcomes were not available, BMD data were evaluated and evidence downgraded to very low certainty); 2) a very high fracture risk category was added; 3) a preference for anabolic agent as initial OP therapy in very high fracture risk was made; 4) a need for sequential therapy after DEN, ROM, and PTH/PTHrP was made; and 5) we recommended the choice of therapies be based on clinician and patient preferences and comorbidities, rather than rank ordering the available OP therapies.</p><p>We risk stratified patients as low, moderate, high or very high risk of fracture based on FRAX 10-year probability and DXA t-or z-scores (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ref>). Similar to other organizational postmenopausal OP guidelines (AACE, SBEM, UK, and National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF)) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>, we have now included a very high fracture risk category (prior OP fracture(s) or BMD tscore ≤-3.5 or FRAX (GC-Adjusted) 10-year risk of MOF ≥30% or hip ≥4.5% or high GC ≥30 mg/day for &gt;30 days or cumulative doses ≥5 g/year) (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3,</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">and5</ref>). These cut points were used to stratify PICO questions and weigh potential benefits versus harms of OP therapy. For prednisone-equivalent doses &gt;7.5 mg/day, a FRAX GC correction is recommended and is achieved by multiplying the risk of MOF by 1.15 and the risk of hip fractures by 1.2. Fracture risk is considered highest for patients treated with very high (≥30 mg/day) or large cumulative GC doses (≥5 g/year) <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(75)</ref>.</p><p>Risk assessment in children, youths, and adults &lt;40 years is not as clear because these populations have substantially lower fracture risk than older adults. BP treatment for children was recommended only after a diagnosis of pediatric OP, which requires a clinically significant history of vertebral or long bone fractures. For children with a GC-associated fracture who continue to take high-dose GC therapy (&gt;0.1 mg/kg/day), BP therapy is warranted.</p><p>For adults ≥40 years, the panel voted to give clinicians the ability to select an OP therapy based on the patient's specific comorbidities and preferences, BMD values, fracture history, and other characteristics, rather than rank ordering the medication recommendations. Fracture prevention data in GIOP is currently limited to oral BP and PTH. Anabolic agents may be the preferred initial therapy for those at very high risk for fracture based on BMD and vertebral fracture prevention superiority compared to anti-resorptives in patients with very high risk postmenopausal OP. Of note, abaloparatide and ROM are not approved in GIOP, and we recognize it may be difficult to access these medications for GIOP.</p><p>The panel specifically noted that the potential harms of RAL (venous thromboembolism [VTE] and fatal stroke) and ROM (major myocardial infarction, stroke, and death) would often favor the other available options when possible.</p><p>The panel emphasized the need for shared decision-making with patients to ensure they understand that some OP therapies (DEN, PTH/PTHrP, ROM) require another course of antiresorptive OP therapy to prevent rapid bone loss and vertebral fractures <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77)</ref>. Discontinuation of DEN without the addition of anti-resorptive therapy is associated with vertebral fractures occurring as soon as 7 to 9 months after the last dose <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">(76,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">77)</ref>. Until the optimal therapy strategy is determined, many experts favor starting BP therapy 6 to 7 months after discontinuation of DEN for at least 1 year <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(78)</ref>. Although the use of PTH after DEN causes transient loss of hip BMD, these drugs have been successfully cycled with increases in BMD <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67)</ref>. It is important that clinicians, patients, and/or their care partners understand and discuss the need for additional OP therapy after completing DEN, PTH/PTHrP, or ROM therapy.</p><p>The use of OP medications in patients after kidney transplant and with CKD was addressed in this guideline. When eGFR &lt;35 mL/min, the risk of renal osteodystrophy is significantly increased, including adynamic bone disease, osteomalacia, osteitis fibrosa cystica, and mixed uremic osteodystrophy. As such, MBD expert evaluation for CKD-MBD is conditionally recommended to exclude these conditions. Once excluded, no dose adjustment is needed when prescribing DEN, PTH/PTHrP, or ROM, but BP should be avoided. Use of DEN in this group may lead to prolonged and more severe hypocalcemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">(60)</ref>.</p><p>A limitation of this guideline is the lack of fracture data in GIOP-specific clinical trials and population studies. As such, general OP population clinical trials data were reviewed when GIOP data were not available. This introduced indirectness into the certainty of the evidence and imprecision in the estimate of benefits for treatment in the GIOP population. Because of these limitations, most of the recommendations in this guideline are conditional.</p><p>Future studies in the treatment of GIOP should be powered to assess fracture risk reduction. Studies should focus on children and patients with CKD stage 4 and 5. As part of risk assessment, studies should explore the use of quantitative computed tomography (CT), bone finite element analysis from CT scans, and BMD measurements from CT colonography. It would be helpful to have validated fracture prediction scores for patients aged &lt;40 years. More studies are needed to better identify the patient populations that might benefit from combination therapy and sequential therapy in GIOP. Additional studies are required to determine the best treatment options and duration of therapy after discontinuation of DEN. In conclusion, GIOP remains a common and challenging clinical scenario that is frequently unrecognized and undertreated. By systematically synthesizing the current knowledge and available clinical trials, we have provided an updated guideline to help clinicians best care for patients requiring long-term GC use.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>ABL = Abaloparatide; BMD = bone mineral density; BP = bisphosphonate; DEN = Denosumab; FRAX = Fracture Risk Assessment Tool; GC = glucocorticoid; MOF = major osteoporotic fracture; PTH = parathyroid hormone; PTHrP = PTH-related protein; RAL = Raloxifene; RANKL = Receptor activator of NF-κβ-Ligand; ROM = Romosozumab; TER = Teriparatide; VTE = venous thromboembolism. † FRAX GC correction example: if hip fracture risk is 2.0% multiply by 1.2 for adjusted risk = 2.4%. ‡ Use with caution in patients who may become pregnant due higher potency and longer half-life in fetal bones. § Avoid in young adults with open growth plates. # Use with caution in patients of child-bearing potential due to potential fetal harm.
