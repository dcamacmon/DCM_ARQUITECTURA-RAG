<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>A panel of adult and pediatric rheumatologists and endocrinologists updated the systematic literature review and included currently available medications for the prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid (GC)-induced osteoporosis. A patient panel was included in this update.</p><p>Similar to the 2017 guideline, we recommend risk stratifying patients as being at low, moderate, or high risk of fracture (Adults ≥40 years, FRAX® 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture &lt;10%, 10-19%, or ≥20% respectively). We added a very high risk category (prior osteoporotic fracture(s) or bone mineral density (BMD) T score ≤ -3.5 or FRAX (GC-adjusted) 10-year risk of MOF ≥30% or hip ≥4.5% or high GC ≥30 mg/day for &gt;30 days or cumulative doses ≥5 g/year. These cut points were used to stratify PICO questions and weigh potential benefits versus harms, when considering osteoporosis (OP) therapy. For all adults initiating or continuing GC therapy ≥2.5mg/day for &gt;3 months, who have never had fracture risk assessment or been treated with OP therapy, initial clinical fracture risk assessment is strongly recommended over no assessment. Clinical fracture risk factor assessment includes the dose, duration, and pattern of GC use, alcohol use, smoking history, hypogonadism, history of prior fractures, low body weight, significant weight loss, parental history of hip fracture, fall history, thyroid disease, hyperparathyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, malabsorption, chronic liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and height loss. If available, BMD testing with VFA or spinal x-ray is recommended as soon as possible after starting GC therapy for adults and every 1-2 years thereafter while continuing GC therapy.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Osteoporosis Medications for Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease or Following Renal Transplant</head><p>Bisphosphonates should generally not be used in patients with an eGFR &lt; 35 ml/min. When eGFR is &lt; 35 ml/min, the risk of renal osteodystrophy, including adynamic bone disease, osteomalacia, osteitis fibrosa cystica and mixed uremic osteodystrophy, is increased. As such, metabolic bone disease expert evaluation for chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is conditionally recommended to exclude these conditions. Hyperparathyroidism should also be assessed. Once excluded, no dose adjustment is needed when prescribing DEN, PTH/PTHrP, or romosozumab (ROM). </p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 : Definitions of selected terms used in the recommendations and upgraded position statements for GIOP Term Adults ≥40 years of age Adults &lt;40 years of age Major osteoporotic fracture (MOF)</head><label>1</label><figDesc></figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell>Non-traumatic or pathological</cell><cell>Non-traumatic or pathological</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>fractures of the spine, hip, wrist,</cell><cell>fractures of the spine, hip, wrist, or</cell></row><row><cell></cell><cell>or humerus</cell><cell>humerus</cell></row><row><cell>Clinical fracture</cell><cell>History of GC use, evaluation for</cell><cell>History of GC use, evaluation for</cell></row><row><cell>risk assessment</cell><cell>falls, fractures, frailty, secondary</cell><cell>falls, fractures, frailty, secondary</cell></row></table></figure>

It also addresses sequential therapy, which was not addressed in the past. Patients should know that osteoporosis therapy with denosumab (DEN), teriparatide (PTH), PTHrP, or ROM will need sequential osteoporosis therapy to prevent bone loss after these drugs are discontinued. Recommendations for sequential therapies are based in part on initial study designs, long term follow-up studies, and new clinical trials. Patients completing a course of DEN should transition to 1-2 years of a BP. Patients completing a course of PTH, PTHrP, or ROM need to transition to a BP or DEN. Discontinuation of DEN after two or more doses has been associated with rapid bone loss and development of new vertebral compression fractures as soon as 7-9 months after the last dose. As such, BP therapy is recommended beginning at 6-7 months after the last dose of DEN. The precise timing, dose and duration of BP use after DEN cessation is under study, but treatment for at least 1 year seems prudent, until additional research is available. Stopping PTH/PTHrP without transition to another therapy can also result in bone loss, which can be prevented by institution of oral or IV BP or DEN. Stopping ROM without transition to another therapy can result in bone loss, which can be prevented by the institution of oral or IV BP.</figDesc><table><row><cell>We conditionally recommend treating with</cell><cell>Very low</cell><cell>7.1b-7.2b</cell><cell>148-153</cell></row><row><cell>an oral or IV BP.</cell><cell></cell><cell></cell><cell></cell></row><row><cell cols="4">GIOP = Glucocorticoid-induced OP, BMP = Bone mineral density, GC = glucocorticoids, BP =</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">bisphosphonate, IV = intravenous, DEN = denosumab, PTH/PTHrP = parathyroid hormone/ parathyroid</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">hormone related protein, RAL = raloxifene, ROM = romosozumab, OP = OP; PICO = Patients,</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">intervention, comparison, outcome; CAL/VIT D/LM = calcium/ vitamin D/ lifestyle modifications; #</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">strong recommendation based on fracture data, $ conditional due to lack of fracture data, % who are not</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">planning on pregnancy during the OP treatment period or are using effective birth control if sexually</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">active; CAL = calcium; CVD = cardiovascular disease; OP = osteoporosis; PICO = Patients,</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">intervention, comparison, outcome; GIOP = Glucocorticoid-induced OP; U.S. RDA = United States</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">Recommended Dietary Allowances; CKD-MBD = chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder;</cell></row><row><cell cols="4">*includes osteomalacia, adynamic bone disease, osteitis fibrosa cystica, mixed uremic osteodystrophy</cell></row></table></figure>
