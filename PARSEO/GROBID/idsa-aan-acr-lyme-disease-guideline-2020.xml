<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>It is important to realize that guidelines cannot always account for individual variation among patients. They are assessments of current scientific and clinical information provided as an educational service; are not continually updated and may not reflect the most recent evidence (new evidence may emerge between the time information is developed and when it is published or read); should not be considered inclusive of all proper treatments methods of care, or as a statement of the standard of care; do not mandate any particular course of medical care; and are not intended to supplant physician judgment with respect to particular patients or special clinical situations. Whether and the extent to which to follow guidelines is voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the physician in the light of each patient's individual circumstances. Although IDSA, AAN, and ACR make every effort to present accurate, complete, and reliable information, these guidelines are presented "as is" without any warranty, either express or implied. IDSA, AAN, and ACR (and their officers, directors, members, employees, and agents) assume no responsibility for any loss, damage, or claim with respect to any liabilities, including direct, special, indirect, or consequential damages, incurred in connection with these guidelines or reliance on the information presented.</p><p>The guidelines represent the proprietary and copyrighted property of IDSA, AAN, and ACR.

This guideline does not include comprehensive recommendations for babesiosis and tick-borne rickettsial infections, which are published in separate guidelines. The target audience for this guideline includes primary care physicians and specialists caring for this condition such as infectious diseases specialists, emergency physicians, internists, pediatricians, family physicians, neurologists, rheumatologists, cardiologists, and dermatologists in North America.</p><p>Summarized below are the 2020 recommendations for the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Lyme disease. The panel followed a systematic process used in the development of other Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA), American Academy of Neurology (AAN), and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) clinical practice guidelines, which included a standardized methodology for rating the certainty of the evidence and strength of recommendation using the GRADE approach (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>). A detailed description of background, methods, evidence summary and rationale that support each recommendation, and knowledge gaps can be found online in the full text (<ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41562/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ art.41562/ abstract</ref>).</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Repellents to prevent tick bites</head><p>Recommendation:</p><p>1. For the prevention of tick bites, we recommend N, N-Diethyl-meta-toluamide (DEET), picaridin, ethyl-3-(Nn-butyl-N-acetyl) aminopropionate (IR3535), oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE), p-methane-3,8-diol (PMD), 2-undecanone, or permethrin (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Removal of attached ticks</head><p>Recommendations:</p><p>1. We recommend promptly removing attached ticks by mechanical means using a clean fine-tipped tweezer (or a comparable device) inserted between the tick body and the skin (good practice statement). 2. We recommend against burning an attached tick (with a match or other heat device) or applying noxious chemicals or petroleum products to coax its detachment (good practice statement).</p></div>

We recommend that prophylactic antibiotic therapy be given only to adults and children within 72 hours of removal of an identified high-risk tick bite, but not for bites that are equivocal risk or low risk (strong recommendation, high-quality evidence).</p><p>Comment: If a tick bite cannot be classified with a high level of certainty as a high-risk bite, a wait-and-watch approach is recommended. A tick bite is considered to be high-risk only if it meets the following 3 criteria: the tick bite was from (a) an identified Ixodes spp. vector species, (b) it occurred in a highly endemic area, and (c) the tick was attached for ≥36 hours. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. What is the preferred antibiotic regimen for the chemoprophylaxis of Lyme disease following a high-risk tick bite?</head><p>Recommendation:</p><p>1. For high-risk Ixodes spp. bites in all age groups, we recommend the administration of a single dose of oral doxycycline within 72 hours of tick removal over observation (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).</p><p>Comment: Doxycycline is given as a single oral dose, 200 mg for adults and 4.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum dose of 200 mg) for children.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. What is the preferred diagnostic testing strategy for erythema migrans?</head><p>Recommendations:</p><p>1. In patients with potential tick exposure in a Lyme disease endemic area who have 1 or more skin lesions compatible with erythema migrans, we recommend clinical diagnosis rather than laboratory testing (strong recommendation, moderatequality evidence). 2. In patients with 1 or more skin lesions suggestive of, but atypical for erythema migrans, we suggest antibody testing performed on an acute-phase serum sample (followed by a convalescent-phase serum sample if the initial result is negative) rather than currently available direct detection methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or culture performed on blood or skin samples (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).</p><p>Comment: If needed, the convalescent-phase serum sample should be collected at least 2-3 weeks after collection of the acute-phase serum sample.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VI. What are the preferred antibiotic regimens for the treatment of erythema migrans?</head><p>Recommendation:</p><p>1. For patients with erythema migrans, we recommend using oral antibiotic therapy with doxycycline, amoxicillin, or cefuroxime axetil (strong recommendation; moderate-quality evidence). Comment: For patients unable to take both doxycycline and beta-lactam antibiotics, the preferred second-line agent is azithromycin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VII. How long should a patient with erythema migrans be treated?</head><p>Recommendation:</p><p>1. We recommend that patients with erythema migrans be treated with either a 10-day course of doxycycline or a 14-day course of amoxicillin or cefuroxime axetil rather than longer treatment courses (strong recommendation, moderatequality evidence). Comment: If azithromycin is used, the indicated duration is 5-10 days, with a 7-day course preferred in the United States, as this duration of therapy was used in the largest clinical trial performed in the United States (3).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>VIII. Should patients with the southern tickassociated rash illness (STARI) be treated with antibiotics?</head><p>Recommendation:</p><p>1. In patients who develop an erythema migrans-like skin lesion following the bite of the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum), an illness referred to as STARI, we make no recommendation for or against the use of antibiotics (no recommendation; knowledge gap). Comment: In certain geographic regions both STARI and Lyme disease are endemic (4). Distinguishing single erythema migrans due to Lyme disease from STARI may not be possible clinically unless the responsible tick has been identified <ref type="bibr">(5)</ref>. When STARI cannot be distinguished from Lyme disease-associated erythema migrans in areas endemic for both conditions, antibiotic therapy directed toward Lyme disease is indicated.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IX. What is the preferred diagnostic testing strategy for Lyme neuroborreliosis?</head><p>Recommendations:</p><p>1. When assessing patients for possible Lyme neuroborreliosis involving either the peripheral nervous system (PNS) or central nervous system (CNS), we recommend serum antibody testing rather than PCR or culture of either cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>X. For which neurologic presentations should patients be tested for Lyme disease?</head><p>Recommendations:</p><p>1. In patients presenting with 1 or more of the following acute disorders: meningitis, painful radiculoneuritis, mononeuropathy multiplex including confluent mononeuropathy multiplex, acute cranial neuropathies (particularly VII, VIII, less commonly III, V, VI, and others), or in patients with evidence of spinal cord (or rarely brain) inflammation, the former particularly in association with painful radiculitis involving related spinal cord segments, and with epidemiologically plausible exposure to ticks infected with B. burgdorferi, we recommend testing for Lyme disease (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). 2. In patients with typical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, dementia or cognitive decline, or new-onset seizures, we recommend against routine testing for Lyme disease (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). 3. In patients with neurologic syndromes other than those listed in <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[1]</ref> or <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>, in the absence of a history of other clinical or epidemiologic support for the diagnosis of Lyme disease, we recommend against screening for Lyme disease (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). 4. In patients presenting with nonspecific magnetic resonance imaging white matter abnormalities confined to the brain in the absence of a history of other clinical or epidemiologic support for the diagnosis of Lyme disease, we suggest against testing for Lyme disease (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XI. Should adult patients with psychiatric illnesses be tested for Lyme disease?</head><p>Recommendation:</p><p>1. In patients with psychiatric illness, we recommend against routine testing for Lyme disease (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XII. Should children with developmental, behavioral, or psychiatric disorders be tested for Lyme disease?</head><p>Recommendation:</p><p>1. In children presenting with developmental, behavioral, or psychiatric disorders, we suggest against routinely testing for Lyme disease (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XIII. What are the preferred antibiotic regimens for the treatment of acute neurologic manifestations of Lyme disease without parenchymal involvement of the brain or spinal cord?</head><p>Recommendation:</p><p>1. In patients with Lyme disease-associated meningitis, cranial neuropathy, radiculoneuropathy, or with other PNS manifestations, we recommend using intravenous (IV) ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, penicillin G, or oral doxycycline over other antimicrobials (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Comment: Decisions about the choice of antibiotic among these, including the route of administration, should primarily be made based on individual factors such as side effect profile, ease of administration, ability to tolerate oral medication, concerns about compliance unrelated to effectiveness. Treatment route may be changed from IV to oral during treatment. The preferred antibiotic duration is 14-21 days.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XIV. Should patients with Lyme disease-related parenchymal involvement of the brain or spinal cord be treated with oral or intravenous antibiotics?</head><p>Recommendation:</p><p>1. In patients with Lyme disease-associated parenchymal involvement of the brain or spinal cord, we recommend using IV over oral antibiotics (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XV. Should patients with Lyme disease and facial nerve palsy receive corticosteroids in addition to antimicrobial therapy?</head><p>Recommendation:</p><p>1. In patients with Lyme disease-associated facial nerve palsy, we make no recommendation on the use of corti-costeroids in addition to antibiotics (no recommendation; knowledge gap). Comment: In patients age 16 or older presenting with acute facial nerve palsy but without other objective clinical or serologic evidence of Lyme disease, corticosteroid treatment should be administered within 72 hours in accordance with current facial nerve palsy guideline recommendations <ref type="bibr">(6)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XVI. Should all patients with early Lyme disease receive an electrocardiogram (ECG) to screen for Lyme carditis?</head><p>Recommendation:</p><p>1. We suggest performing an ECG only in patients with signs or symptoms consistent with Lyme carditis (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence). Comment: Symptoms and signs of cardiac involvement in Lyme disease include dyspnea, edema, palpitations, lightheadedness, chest pain, and syncope.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XVII. Which patients with Lyme carditis require hospitalization?</head><p>Recommendation:</p><p>1. In patients with or at risk for severe cardiac complications of Lyme disease including those with significant PR prolongation (PR &gt;300 milliseconds), other arrhythmias, or clinical manifestations of myopericarditis, we recommend hospital admission with continuous ECG monitoring (strong recommendation, very low-quality evidence).</p><p>Comment: Clinical manifestations of Lyme carditis include exercise intolerance, palpitations, presyncope, syncope, pericarditic pain, evidence of pericardial effusion, elevated biomarkers (such as troponin), edema, and shortness of breath.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XVIII. What pacing modality should be used if needed for the management of Lyme carditis?</head><p>Recommendation:</p><p>1. For patients with symptomatic bradycardia due to Lyme carditis that cannot be managed medically, we recommend temporary pacing modalities rather than implanting a permanent pacemaker (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XIX. What are the preferred antibiotic regimens for the treatment of Lyme carditis?</head><p>Recommendations:</p><p>1. In outpatients with Lyme carditis, we suggest oral antibiotics over IV antibiotics (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). 2. In the hospitalized patient with Lyme carditis, we suggest initially using IV ceftriaxone over oral antibiotics until there is evidence of clinical improvement, then switching to oral antibiotics to complete treatment (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). 3. For the treatment of Lyme carditis, we suggest 14-21 days of total antibiotic therapy over longer durations of treatment (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Comment: Oral antibiotic choices for Lyme carditis are doxycycline, amoxicillin, cefuroxime axetil, and azithromycin.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XX. Should patients being evaluated for acute myocarditis/pericarditis or chronic cardiomyopathy of unknown cause be tested for Lyme disease?</head><p>Recommendations:</p><p>1. In patients with acute myocarditis/pericarditis of unknown cause in an appropriate epidemiologic setting, we recommend testing for Lyme disease (strong recommendation, low-quality evidence). 2. In patients with chronic cardiomyopathy of unknown cause, we suggest against routine testing for Lyme disease (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XXI. What is the preferred diagnostic testing strategy for Lyme arthritis?</head><p>Recommendations:</p><p>1. When assessing possible Lyme arthritis, we recommend serum antibody testing over PCR or culture of blood or synovial fluid/ tissue (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). 2. In seropositive patients for whom the diagnosis of Lyme arthritis is being considered but treatment decisions require more definitive information, we recommend PCR applied to synovial fluid or tissue rather than Borrelia culture of those samples (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XXII. What are the preferred antibiotic regimens for the initial treatment of Lyme arthritis?</head><p>Recommendation:</p><p>1. For patients with Lyme arthritis, we recommend using oral antibiotic therapy for 28 days (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XXIII. What are the approaches to patients in whom Lyme arthritis has not completely resolved?</head><p>Recommendations:</p><p>1. In patients with Lyme arthritis with partial response (mild residual joint swelling) after a first course of oral antibiotic, we make no recommendation for a second course of antibiotic versus observation (no recommendation, knowledge gap).</p><p>Comment: Consideration should be given to exclusion of other causes of joint swelling than Lyme arthritis, medication adherence, duration of arthritis prior to initial treatment, degree of synovial proliferation versus joint swelling, patient preferences, and cost. A second course of oral antibiotics for up to 1 month may be a reasonable alternative for patients in whom synovial proliferation is modest compared to joint swelling and for those who prefer repeating a course of oral antibiotics before considering IV therapy. 2. In patients with Lyme arthritis with no or minimal response (moderate to severe joint swelling with minimal reduction of the joint effusion) to an initial course of oral antibiotic, we suggest a 2-4-week course of IV ceftriaxone over a second course of oral antibiotics (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XXIV. How should post-antibiotic (previously termed antibiotic-refractory) Lyme arthritis be treated?</head><p>Recommendation:</p><p>1. In patients who have failed 1 course of oral antibiotics and 1 course of IV antibiotics, we suggest a referral to a rheumatologist or other trained specialist for consideration of the use of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, biologic agents, intraarticular steroids, or arthroscopic synovectomy (weak recommendation, very low-quality evidence). Comment: Antibiotic therapy for longer than 8 weeks is not expected to provide additional benefit to patients with persistent arthritis if that treatment has included 1 course of IV therapy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XXV. Should patients with persistent symptoms following standard treatment of Lyme disease receive additional antibiotics?</head><p>Recommendation:</p><p>1. For patients who have persistent or recurring nonspecific symptoms such as fatigue, pain, or cognitive impairment following recommended treatment for Lyme disease, but who lack objective evidence of reinfection or treatment failure, we recommend against additional antibiotic therapy (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). Comment: Evidence of persistent infection or treatment failure would include objective signs of disease activity, such as arthritis, meningitis, or neuropathy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XXVI. What is the preferred antibiotic regimen for the treatment of borrelial lymphocytoma?</head><p>Recommendation:</p><p>1. In patients with borrelial lymphocytoma, we suggest oral antibiotic therapy for 14 days (weak recommendation, lowquality evidence).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XXVII. What is the preferred antibiotic regimen for the treatment of acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans?</head><p>Recommendation:</p><p>1. In patients with acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, we suggest oral antibiotic therapy for 21-28 days over shorter durations (weak recommendation, low-quality evidence).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>XXVIII. Under what circumstances should a patient with Lyme disease be evaluated for coinfection with A. phagocytophilum or B. microti?</head><p>Recommendation:</p><p>1 To provide thorough transparency, the IDSA/AAN/ACR requires full disclosure of all relationships, regardless of relevancy to the guideline topic. The assessment of disclosed relationships for possible COI is based on the relative weight of the financial relationship (i.e., monetary amount) and the relevance of the relationship (i.e., the degree to which an association might reasonably be interpreted by an independent observer as related to the topic or recommendation of consideration).

In patients with Lyme disease who have a high-grade fever or characteristic laboratory abnormalities, clinicians should assess for possible coinfection with Anaplasma phagocytophilum and/or B. microti infection in geographic regions where these infections are endemic (good practice statement). Comment: Coinfection should be investigated in patients who have a persistent fever for &gt;1 day while on antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. If fever persists despite treatment with doxycycline, B. microti infection is an important consideration.Characteristic laboratory abnormalities found in both anaplasmosis and babesiosis include thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and/or anemia. Evidence of hemolysis, such as elevated indirect bilirubin level, anemia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase, is particularly suggestive of babesiosis. data.
