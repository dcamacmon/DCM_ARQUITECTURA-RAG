# Table 1. Risk factors for the development of ILD that may indicate the need for screening*

|Disease|Risk factors|
|---|---|
|Systemic sclerosis|• Anti–Scl-70 positivity, antinuclear antibody with nucleolar pattern¹³ • Diffuse cutaneous subtype, male sex • African American race14,15 • Early disease (ﬁrst 5–7 y after onset) • Elevated acute phase reactants13,16|
|Rheumatoid arthritis|• High-titer rheumatoid factor, high-titer anti-CCP17–19 • Cigarette smoking, older age at rheumatoid arthritis onset,22,23 high disease activity|
|Idiopathic inflammatory myopathies|• Male sex,²² higher body mass index • Anti-synthetase (Jo-1, PL7, PL12, EJ, OJ, KS, Ha, Zo), anti–MDA-5, anti-Ku, anti-Pm/Scl, anti-Ro52 antibody positivity • Mechanic’s hands, arthritis/arthralgia|
|Mixed connective tissue disease|• ulcerating lesions²⁴ • Dysphagia, Raynaud phenomenon • Other systemic sclerosis clinical or laboratory features|
|Sjögren disease|• Anti-Ro52 antibody, antinuclear antibody25,26 • Raynaud phenomenon • Older age • Lymphopenia • Severe dental caries|

* These disease features have been identiﬁed as placing a person at increased risk for developing ILD; however, the absence of these risk factors does not preclude the development of ILD in patients with these SARDs. Screening for ILD should be performed in shared decision-making with the rheumatologist and patient. As such, screening for ILD should not necessarily be limited only to those with these risk factors. CCP, cyclic citrullinated peptide; ILD, interstitial lung disease; MDA-5, MDA-5 melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5; SARD, systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease.

# Table 2. Summary of recommendations for screening of SARD-ILD*

| Summary of recommendations |
|---------------------------|
| For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend screening with PFTs over history and physical examination or ambulatory desaturation testing alone. |
| For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend screening with HRCT chest over history and physical examination or PFTs alone. |
| For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend screening with HRCT chest and PFTs over PFTs alone. |
| For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with chest radiography. |
| For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with 6MWD. |
| For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with ambulatory desaturation testing. |
| For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with bronchoscopy. |
| For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we strongly recommend against screening with surgical lung biopsy. |

# Table 3. Summary of recommendations for monitoring for ILD progression*

| Summary of recommendations |
|---------------------------|
| For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend monitoring with PFTs. |
| For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend monitoring with HRCT chest. |
| For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend monitoring with PFTs and HRCT chest over PFTs alone. |
| For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend monitoring with ambulatory desaturation testing. |
| For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend against monitoring with chest radiography. |
| For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend against monitoring with 6MWD. |
| For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend against monitoring with bronchoscopy. |
| For people with IIM-ILD and SSc-ILD, we suggest PFTs for monitoring every 3–6 months rather than either shorter or longer intervals for the first year, then less frequently once stable. |
| For people with RA-ILD, SjD-ILD, and MCTD-ILD, we suggest PFTs for monitoring every 3–12 months rather than shorter or longer intervals for the first year, then less frequently once stable. |
| For people with SARD-ILD, we do not provide guidance about frequency of routine HRCT chest for monitoring ILD but suggest HRCT chest when clinically indicated. |
| For people with SARD-ILD, we suggest assessment for ambulatory desaturation every 3–12 months rather than at shorter or longer intervals. |

* PFTs included spirometry, lung volumes, and DLCO. DLCO, diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide; HRCT chest, high-resolution computed tomography of the chest; IIM, idiopathic inflammatory myopathies; ILD, interstitial lung disease; MCTD, mixed connective tissue disease; PFT, pulmonary function test; RA, rheumatoid arthritis; SARD, systemic autoimmune rheumatic disease; SjD, Sjögren disease; SSc, systemic sclerosis; 6MWD, 6-minute walk test distance.
