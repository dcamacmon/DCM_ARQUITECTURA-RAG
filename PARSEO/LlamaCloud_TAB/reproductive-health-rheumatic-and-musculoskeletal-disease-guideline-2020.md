# Table 1. Safety and efficacy of various contraceptive methods in women with RMD*

|Method|Safety in women with RMD|1-year failure rate, %†| |
|---|---|---|---|
|Highly effective (LARC)|Copper IUD|Safe in all women with RMD; may increase menstrual bleeding|&lt;1|
| |Progestin IUD|Safe in all women with RMD; may decrease menstrual bleeding|&lt;1|
| |Progestin implant|Limited data, but likely safe in all women with RMD|&lt;1|
|Effective|Progestin-only pill (daily)|Safe in all women with RMD; higher rate of breakthrough bleeding than with combined contraceptives; must take same time every day for efficacy|5–8|
| |DMPA (IM injection every 12 weeks)|Safe in most women with RMD; exceptions: positive aPL, at high risk for OP|3|
| |Combined estrogen and progesterone pill (daily)|Safe in most women with RMD; exceptions: positive aPL, very active SLE|5–8|
| |Transdermal patch (weekly)|Safe in most women with RMD; exceptions: positive aPL, SLE; serum estrogen levels higher than with pill or vaginal ring|5–8|
| |Vaginal ring (monthly)|Safe in most women with RMD; exceptions: positive aPL, very active SLE|5–8|
|Less effective|Diaphragm|Safe in all women with RMD|12|
| |Condom|Safe in all women with RMD; only form to prevent STD|18|
| |Fertility awareness–based methods‡|Safe in all women with RMD; limited efficacy, especially if menses are irregular|24|
| |Spermicide|Safe in all women with RMD; use with condoms or diaphragm to improve efficacy|28|

* RMD = rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease; LARC = long-acting reversible contraception; IUD = intrauterine device; DMPA = depot medroxyprogesterone acetate; IM = intramuscular; aPL = antiphospholipid antibody; OP = osteoporosis; SLE = systemic lupus erythematosus; STD = sexually transmitted disease.

† Percent of women who will become pregnant within the first year of typical use.

‡ Methods based on the timing of the menstrual cycle.

* Recommendation numbers, shown in brackets, allow for cross-referencing with supplementary appendices. For more detailed/complete recommendations, see text or Supplementary Appendix 7 (on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41191/abstract). RMD = rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease; GPS = good practice statement; MMF = mycophenolate mofetil (and mycophenolic acid); SLE = systemic lupus erythematosus; aPL = antiphospholipid antibody, meeting laboratory criteria for antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) (Supplementary Appendix 8, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41191/abstract); IVF = in vitro fertilization; CYC = cyclophosphamide; OB APS = APS meeting laboratory criteria and clinical obstetric criteria (Supplementary Appendix 8); LMWH = low molecular weight heparin; IV = intravenous; SS = Sjögren’s syndrome; SSc = systemic sclerosis; RA = rheumatoid arthritis; ACE inhibitor = angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor; ARB = angiotensin receptor blocker; aCL = anticardiolipin antibody; anti-β₂GPI = anti–β₂-glycoprotein I; LAC = lupus anticoagulant; HCQ = hydroxychloroquine; IVIG = IV immunoglobulin; AZA = azathioprine (and 5-fluorouracil); NSAIDs = nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs; COX-2 = cyclooxygenase 2; MTX = methotrexate.

† Highly effective contraceptives are long-acting reversible contraceptives including progestin or copper intrauterine device (IUD) and progestin implant. Effective contraceptives are estrogen-progestin contraceptives (oral, patch, or vaginal ring) and progestin-only (oral, depot medroxyprogesterone acetate [DMPA]).

‡ General indication for hormone replacement therapy: Current recommendations suggest limiting hormone replacement therapy use in healthy postmenopausal women and using the lowest dose that alleviates symptoms for the minimum time necessary. Benefit-risk balance is most favorable for severe vasomotor symptoms in women <60 years old or within 10 years of menopause onset (ref. 61).
