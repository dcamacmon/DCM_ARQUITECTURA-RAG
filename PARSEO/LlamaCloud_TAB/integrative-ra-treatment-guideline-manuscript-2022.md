# Table 2. Guiding principles for the integrative management of rheumatoid arthritis*

| **Guiding principles for the integrative management of rheumatoid arthritis** |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, systemic inflammatory condition that requires early diagnosis, evaluation, and management to achieve optimal outcomes. |
| Rheumatoid arthritis should be treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and follow a treat-to-target management strategy, as detailed in the 2021 ACR Rheumatoid Arthritis Pharmacologic Treatment Guidelines (1). |
| Individuals with chronic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis seek many available therapies to maintain physical function, reduce pain, and improve their quality of life. |
| Treatment decisions should follow a shared decision-making process. Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis present with a variety of manifestations and experiences. |
| Optimum rheumatoid arthritis treatment outcomes are achieved through interprofessional teams providing expert patient-centered care. |
| Recommendations assume no contraindications to listed management strategies. |
| Recommendations pertain to rheumatoid arthritis management. Recommendations do not pertain to clinical situations in which patients have alternative indications for listed treatments. Other general health benefits may exist for listed treatments. |

# Table 7. Research agenda for the integrative management of rheumatoid arthritis

|Evaluate the efﬁcacy and safety of integrative therapies for the management of rheumatoid arthritis. Initial evidence is needed in the areas of activity pacing, energy conservation, activity modiﬁcation, fatigue management, and vocational rehabilitation. Additional strong evidence from larger, well-designed studies is needed in all other areas.
|---|
|Determine the appropriate timing of different integrative interventions in the rheumatoid arthritis disease course.| 
|Examine the delivery, education, and implementation of integrative interventions. For example, evaluating various methods of instruction and training of joint protection and activity pacing interventions.| 
|Establish the cost-effectiveness of different integrative interventions and develop approaches for cost-effective delivery.| 
|Identify barriers to the adoption and implementation of integrative therapies. These may include variability in access, costs, and implicit and/or explicit biases.| 
|Describe the assembly of, communication between, and role delineation among the interprofessional care team delivering pharmacologic and integrative interventions.| 
|Improve access to experienced healthcare professionals who provide integrative interventions.| 
|Determine efﬁcacy and safety of integrative interventions based on rheumatoid arthritis disease manifestations and pharmacologic therapies, e.g., modifying exercise interventions based on disease activity level or diet based on disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs utilized.| 
|Tailor interventions (and their delivery) studied in the general population to individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, e.g., tobacco cessation programs, exercise programs, and weight loss.| 
|Deﬁne efﬁcacy and safety of therapies not included in this guideline such as cannabidiol, vaping, and occupational exposures and protections as well as emerging therapies such as vagal nerve stimulation.|
|Evaluate dietary supplements (especially vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids such as “ﬁsh oil”) in the context of dietary intake. The assessment and implementation of diets should focus on being inclusive of different cultures.| 
|Develop vocational rehabilitation programs and work site modiﬁcations that improve the ability of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis to work without negative stigma in the workplace.| 
|Establish the efﬁcacy and safety of integrative therapies on extraarticular manifestations and long-term rheumatoid arthritis–related outcomes. In addition to disease activity, physical function, pain, and quality of life outcomes considered in this guideline, other outcomes that should be considered are longevity, cardiovascular disease, lung disease, cancer, osteoporosis, and infection.| 
|Develop research methodology to study integrative therapies, e.g., deﬁning an adequate control intervention. Publication of research standards for integrative therapies relevant to rheumatoid arthritis to guide research efforts.| 
|Establish dedicated funding from organizations to study integrative rheumatoid arthritis therapies and their implementation.|
