*Active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is defined as disease causing symptoms at an unacceptably bothersome level as reported by the patient, and judged by the examining clinician to be due to PsA based on ≥1 of the following: swollen joints, tender joints, dactylitis, enthesitis, axial disease, active skin and/or nail involvement, and extraarticular inflammatory manifestations such as uveitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Oral small molecules (OSMs) are defined as methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine (SSZ), leflunomide (LEF), cyclosporine (CSA), or apremilast (APR) and do not include tofacitinib, which was handled separately since its efficacy/safety profile is much different from that of other OSMs listed above. OSM- and other treatment–naive is defined as naive to treatment with OSMs, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), interleukin-17 inhibitors (IL-17i), and IL-12/23i; patients may have received nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, and/or other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions.

† When there were no published studies, we relied on the clinical experience of the panelists, which was designated very-low-quality evidence.

‡ Because there are currently no widely agreed-upon definitions of disease severity, PsA severity should be established by the health care provider and patient on a case-by-case basis. For the purposes of these recommendations, severity is considered a broader concept than disease activity in that it encompasses the level of disease activity at a given time point, as well as the presence of poor prognostic factors and long-term damage. Examples of severe PsA disease include the presence of ≥1 of the following: a poor prognostic factor (erosive disease, elevated levels of inflammation markers such as C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate attributable to PsA), long-term damage that interferes with function (e.g., joint deformities, vision loss), highly active disease that causes major impairment in quality of life (i.e., active psoriatic inflammatory disease at many sites [including dactylitis, enthesitis] or function-limiting inflammatory disease at few sites), and rapidly progressive disease.

§ Because there are currently no widely agreed-upon definitions of disease severity, psoriasis severity should be established by the health care provider and patient on a case-by-case basis. In clinical trials, severe psoriasis has been defined as a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score (25) of ≥12 and a body surface area score of ≥10. In clinical practice, however, the PASI tool is not standardly utilized given its cumbersome nature. In 2007, the National Psoriasis Foundation published an expert consensus statement, which defined moderate-to-severe disease as a body surface area of ≥5% (68). In cases in which the involvement is in critical areas, such as the face, hands or feet, nails, intertriginous areas, scalp, or where the burden of the disease causes significant disability or impairment of physical or mental functioning, the disease can be severe despite the lower amount of surface area of skin involved. The need to factor in the unique circumstances of the individual patient is of critical importance, but this threshold provides some guidance in the care of patients.

*Active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is defined as disease causing symptoms at an unacceptably bothersome level as reported by the patient, and judged by the examining clinician to be due to PsA based on ≥1 of the following: swollen joints, tender joints, dactylitis, enthesitis, axial disease, active skin and/or nail involvement, and extraarticular inflammatory manifestations such as uveitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

†When there were no published studies, we relied on the clinical experience of the panelists, which was designated very-low-quality evidence.

‡Axial disease is generally treated according to the American College of Rheumatology/Spondylitis Association of America/Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network recommendations for spondyloarthritis (SpA).

§ Because there are currently no widely agreed-upon definitions of disease severity, psoriasis severity should be established by the health care provider and patient on a case-by-case basis. In clinical trials, severe psoriasis has been defined as a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of ≥12 and a body surface area score of ≥10. In clinical practice, however, the PASI tool is not standardly utilized given its cumbersome nature. In 2007, the National Psoriasis Foundation published an expert consensus statement, which defined moderate-to-severe disease as a body surface area of ≥5%. In cases in which the involvement is in critical areas, such as the face, hands or feet, nails, intertriginous areas, scalp, or where the burden of the disease causes significant disability or impairment of physical or mental functioning, the disease can be severe despite the lower amount of surface area of skin involved. The need to factor in the unique circumstances of the individual patient is of critical importance, but this threshold provides some guidance in the care of patients.

¶ Oral small molecules (OSMs) are defined as methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine, leflunomide, cyclosporine, or apremilast and do not include tofacitinib, which was handled separately since its efficacy/safety profile is much different from that of other OSMs listed above. OSM- and biologic treatment–naive is defined as naive to treatment with OSMs, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), interleukin-17 inhibitors (IL-17i), and IL-12/23i; patients may have received nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, and/or other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions.

# It should be noted that for the enthesitis questions (PICO 49, 50, and 51), the existing evidence was mainly drawn from the apremilast studies, as no randomized controlled trial report described enthesitis outcomes for the other OSMs.

|Recommendations|Level of evidence (evidence [refs.] reviewed)†|

|2. Start an OSM over a TNFi biologic (PICO 64)|Moderate (33, 120)|

§ Because there are currently no widely agreed-upon definitions of disease severity, PsA severity should be established by the health care provider and patient on a case-by-case basis. For the purposes of these recommendations, severity is considered a broader concept than disease activity in that it encompasses the level of disease activity at a given time point, as well as the presence of poor prognostic factors and long-term damage. Examples of severe PsA disease include the presence of ≥1 of the following: a poor prognostic factor (erosive disease, elevated levels of inflammation markers such as C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate attributable to PsA), long-term damage that interferes with function (e.g., joint deformities, vision loss), highly active disease that causes major impairment in quality of life (i.e., active psoriatic inflammatory disease at many sites [including dactylitis, enthesitis] or function-limiting inflammatory disease at few sites), and rapidly progressive disease.

¶ Because there are currently no widely agreed-upon definitions of disease severity, psoriasis severity should be established by the health care provider and patient on a case-by-case basis. In clinical trials, severe psoriasis has been defined as a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score (25) of ≥12 and a body surface area score of ≥10. In clinical practice, however, the PASI tool is not standardly utilized given its cumbersome nature. In 2007, the National Psoriasis Foundation published an expert consensus statement, which defined moderate-to-severe disease as a body surface area of ≥5% (68). In cases in which the involvement is in critical areas, such as the face, hands or feet, nails, intertriginous areas, scalp, or where the burden of the disease causes significant disability or impairment of physical or mental functioning, the disease can be severe despite the lower amount of surface area of skin involved. The need to factor in the unique circumstances of the individual patient is of critical importance, but this threshold provides some guidance in the care of patients.
