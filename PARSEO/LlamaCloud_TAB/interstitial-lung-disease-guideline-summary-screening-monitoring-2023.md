# Table 1. Summary of recommendations for screening of SARD-ILD

| Summary of recommendations |
|---------------------------|
| For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend screening with PFTs. |
| For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend screening with HRCT of the chest. |
| For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend screening with HRCT chest and PFTs over PFTs alone. |
| For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with 6MWD. |
| For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with chest radiography. |
| For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with ambulatory desaturation testing. |
| For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with bronchoscopy. |
| For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we strongly recommend against screening with surgical lung biopsy. |

# Table 2. Summary of Recommendations for Monitoring for ILD Progression

| Summary of recommendations |
|---------------------------|
| For people with SARDs-ILD, we conditionally recommend monitoring with PFTs. |
| For people with SARDs-ILD, we conditionally recommend monitoring with HRCT chest. |
| For people with SARDs-ILD, we conditionally recommend monitoring with PFTs and HRCT chest over PFTs alone. |
| For people with SARDs-ILD, we conditionally recommend monitoring with ambulatory desaturation testing. |
| For people with SARDs-ILD, we conditionally recommend against monitoring with chest radiography. |
| For people with SARDs-ILD, we conditionally recommend against monitoring with 6MWD. |
| For people with SARDs-ILD, we conditionally recommend against monitoring with bronchoscopy. |
| For people with IIM-ILD and SSc-ILD, we suggest PFTs for monitoring every 3-6 months rather than either shorter or longer intervals, for the first year, then less frequently once stable. |
| For people with RA-ILD, SjD-ILD, and MCTD-ILD, we suggest PFTs for monitoring every 3-12 months rather than shorter or longer intervals, for the first year, then less frequently once stable. |
| For people with SARDs-ILD, we do not provide guidance about frequency of routine HRCT chest for monitoring ILD but suggest HRCT when clinically indicated. |
| For people with SARDs-ILD, we suggest assessment for ambulatory desaturation every 3-12 months rather than at shorter or longer intervals. |
