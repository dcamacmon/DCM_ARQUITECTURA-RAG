* Dosing intervals obtained from prescribing information provided online by pharmaceutical companies. Adapted from the 2017 American College of Rheumatology/American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons guideline (26). DMARDs = disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs; SLE = systemic lupus erythematosus; IV = intravenous; PO = by mouth; SC = subcutaneous; IL-17 = interleukin-17.

** Correction added on 24 August 2022, after first online publication on 20 June 2022. One of the biologic medications to withhold prior to surgery was omitted from Table 2. Golimumab (Simponi) and the corresponding dosing/timing have been added.

† Recommendation that has changed since 2017.

‡ Severe SLE indicates organ-threatening disease.

§ Drug added for 2022 update.

¶ For patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, or all SLE for whom antirheumatic therapy was withheld prior to undergoing total joint arthroplasty, antirheumatic therapy should be restarted once the wound shows evidence of healing, any sutures/staples are out, there is no signiﬁcant swelling, erythema, or drainage, and there is no ongoing nonsurgical site infection, which is typically ~14 days.

# Recommendation pertains to infection risk and does not account for risk of cardiac events or venous thromboembolism.

# RESULTS/RECOMMENDATIONS

# Table 3. Recommendations for perioperative management of anti-rheumatic drug therapy in patients with inflammatory arthritis and those with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) undergoing elective total hip arthroplasty (THA) or total knee arthroplasty (TKA)*

|Recommendation/strength of recommendation|Level of evidence|
|---|---|
|For patients with RA, AS, PsA, JIA, or all SLE undergoing THA or TKA, continuing the usual dosing of the following DMARDs through surgery is conditionally recommended: methotrexate, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, and/or apremilast.†|Low to moderate|
|For patients with RA, AS, PsA, or JIA undergoing THA or TKA, withholding all biologics, including rituximab, prior to surgery and planning the surgery after the next dose is due is conditionally recommended.|Low|
|For patients with RA, AS, PsA, or JIA undergoing THA or TKA, withholding tofacitinib, baricitinib, and upadacitinib for at least 3 days prior to surgery is conditionally recommended.‡|Low|
|For patients with SLE (not severe) undergoing THA or TKA, withholding the current dose of mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid, azathioprine, cyclosporine, mizoribine, or tacrolimus 1 week prior to surgery is conditionally recommended.|Low|
|For patients with SLE (not severe) undergoing THA or TKA, withholding the usual dose of belimumab and rituximab prior to surgery is conditionally recommended.|Low|
|For patients with severe SLE who have been deemed appropriate to undergo THA or TKA, continuing the usual dose of mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid (Myfortic), azathioprine, mizoribine, cyclosporine, or tacrolimus, anifrolumab, and voclosporin through surgery is conditionally recommended.‡|Low|
|For patients with severe SLE undergoing THA or TKA, continuing belimumab and planning surgery in the last month of the dosing cycle of rituximab is conditionally recommended.‡|Low|
|For patients with RA, AS, PsA, or all SLE for whom antirheumatic therapy was withheld prior to undergoing TJA, antirheumatic therapy should be restarted once the wound shows evidence of healing, any sutures/staples are out, there is no significant swelling, erythema, or drainage, and there is no ongoing nonsurgical site infection, which is typically ~14 days, is conditionally recommended.|Low|
|For patients with RA, AS, PsA, or all SLE undergoing THA or TKA who are receiving glucocorticoids for their rheumatic condition, continuing their current daily dose of glucocorticoids rather than administering supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoids on the day of surgery is conditionally recommended.|Low|

* RA = rheumatoid arthritis; AS = ankylosing spondylitis; PsA = psoriatic arthritis; JIA = juvenile idiopathic arthritis; DMARDs = disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs; TJA = total joint arthroplasty.
