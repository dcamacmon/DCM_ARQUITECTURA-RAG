|Term|Adults ≥40 years of age|Adults <40 years of age|
|---|---|---|
|MOF|Nontraumatic or pathological fractures of the spine, hip, wrist, or humerus|Nontraumatic or pathological fractures of the spine, hip, wrist, or humerus|

|FRAX GC correction|If GC dose is >7.5 mg/day, multiply the 10-year risk of MOF by 1.15 and the hip fracture risk by 1.2†|Not applicable as FRAX is not validated in this age group|
|Very high fracture risk|Prior OP fracture(s) OR BMD t-score ≤−3.5 OR FRAX (GC-Adjusted) 10-year risk of MOF ≥30% or hip ≥4.5% OR high GC ≥30 mg/day for >30 days OR cumulative doses ≥5 g/y|Prior fracture(s) OR GC ≥30 mg/day OR cumulative ≥5 g/y|
|High fracture risk|BMD t-score ≤−2.5 but >−3.5 OR FRAX (GC Adjusted) 10-year risk of MOF ≥20% but <30% or hip ≥3% but <4.5%|-|
|Moderate fracture risk|FRAX (GC-Adjusted) 10-year risk of MOF ≥10 and <20%, hip >1 and <3% OR BMD t-score between −1 and −2.4|Continuing GC treatment ≥7.5 mg/day for ≥6 months AND BMD z-score < −3 OR significant BMD loss (more than the least significant change of DXA)|

|BP (Alendronate [oral], Risedronate [oral]; Ibandronate [oral/ IV], Zoledronic acid [IV])|We strongly recommend OP treatment for those at moderate, high, or very high risk of fracture. We strongly recommend oral BP over no treatment in high and very high fracture risk due to fracture reduction in GIOP. We conditionally recommend IV BP, ROM, RAL over no treatment in high and very high risk of fracture. In moderate risk, we conditionally recommend BP, DEN, or PTH/PTHrP in no preferred order among these agents.|We conditionally recommend treatment for those at moderate or very high risk of fracture with oral or IV BP,‡ PTH/PTHrP,§ or DEN§#|
|PTH/PTHrP Agonists (TER, ABL, Anti-RANKL, DEN)|We conditionally recommend PTH/PTHrP over anti-resorptives in patients at very high risk of fracture. We conditionally recommend DEN§# or PTH/PTHrP over oral and IV BP in high risk of fracture. In moderate risk, we conditionally recommend BP, DEN, or PTH/PTHrP in no preferred order among these agents.|-|
|Selective estrogen receptor modifier (RAL), Anti-sclerostin (ROM)|We conditionally recommend IV BP, ROM, RAL over no treatment in high and very high risk of fracture. Except in patients intolerant of other agents, we conditionally recommend against RAL due to harms of VTE and fatal stroke or ROM due to uncertain harms including increased myocardial infarction, stroke and death.|-|
