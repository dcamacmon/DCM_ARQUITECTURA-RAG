† COVID-19 vaccines were not included in this guideline because of the fast-changing face of the pandemic and related literature.

‡ The recently approved pneumococcal vaccines, PCV15 and PCV20, were not included in the evidence review but are discussed in the text with reference to current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines.

# Table 2. Glossary of terms

|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|Adjuvant|An ingredient used in some vaccines that helps create a stronger immune response in patients receiving the vaccine|
|Immunogenicity|The ability of a vaccine to elicit an immune response|
|Reactogenicity|Typical symptoms (e.g., fever, sore arm, muscle aches) that occur shortly (days) after vaccine administration either at the site of vaccination or systemically|
|Seroconversion|Development of antibodies to a pathogen, elicited by a vaccine (or infection), in the blood of an individual who previously did not have detectable antibodies|
|Seroprotection|An antibody level capable of protecting against infection or disease|
|Titer|Numerical value indicating the level of antibody against a particular pathogen|

# Table 3. Medication management at the time of non–live attenuated vaccine administration

| |Influenza vaccination|Other non–live attenuated vaccinations|
|---|---|---|
|Methotrexate|Hold methotrexate for 2 weeks after vaccination*|Continue methotrexate|
|Rituximab|Continue rituximab†|Time vaccination for when the next rituximab dose is due, and then hold rituximab for at least 2 weeks after vaccination|
|Immunosuppressive medications other than methotrexate and rituximab|Continue immunosuppressive medication|Continue immunosuppressive medication|

* Hold only if disease activity allows. Non-rheumatology providers, e.g., general pediatricians and internists, are encouraged to give the influenza vaccination and then consult with the patient’s rheumatology provider about holding methotrexate to avoid a missed vaccination opportunity.

† Give influenza vaccination on schedule. Delay any subsequent rituximab dosing for at least 2 weeks after influenza vaccination if disease activity allows.

# Table 4. Whether to give or defer non–live attenuated vaccinations that can be safely given to RMD patients taking immunosuppressive medication.

++ = Strong recommendation.

+ = Conditional recommendation.

* Or the equivalent dose of any other glucocorticoid formulation, or the equivalent pediatric dose.

† Defer vaccination until glucocorticoids are tapered to the equivalent of prednisone <20 mg daily.

# Table 5. Immunosuppressive medication management at the time of live attenuated virus vaccine administration*

| |Hold before live attenuated virus vaccine administration|Hold after live attenuated virus vaccine administration|
|---|---|---|
|Glucocorticoids†|4 weeks|4 weeks|
|Methotrexate, azathioprine‡|4 weeks|4 weeks|

|Anifrolumab|1 dosing interval§|4 weeks|
|Cyclophosphamide, intravenous|1 dosing interval§|4 weeks|
|Rituximab|6 months|4 weeks|
| **IVIG#**  |  |  |                    
| 300–400 mg/kg     | 8 months     |  4 weeks |
|  1 gm/kg   |   10 months            | 4 weeks      |
|2 gm/kg  |  11 months | 4 weeks  |

* TNF = tumor necrosis factor; IL = interleukin; BLyS = B lymphocyte stimulator; IVIG = intravenous immunoglobulin.

† For patients taking the equivalent of prednisone <20 mg/day or <2 mg/kg/day for patients weighing <10 kg or alternate-day glucocorticoid therapy (i.e., “low-level immunosuppression” [15,68]), these low doses can be continued if vaccination is critical and the risk of a disease flare or adrenal insufficiency when the patient is not taking glucocorticoids is high.

‡ For patients taking methotrexate≤0.4 mg/kg/week or azathioprine ≤3 mg/kg/day (“low-level immunosuppression” [15,68]), hold times can be shortened if vaccination is critical and the risk of a disease flare when the patient is not taking immunosuppression is high.

§ For medications with >1 dosing interval approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the longest interval should be chosen (e.g., hold subcutaneous adalimumab for 2 weeks, although it can be dosed every 1 or every 2 weeks).

¶ In children with autoinﬂammatory disorders or systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis in whom the risk of disease flare if biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are held is very high, shorter hold times can be considered if live attenuated vaccination is critical.

#The recommendation to hold IVIG prior to vaccination is designed to enhance vaccine efﬁcacy, not safety. In some situations, such as during a measles outbreak, earlier vaccination would be preferred over delay.


# Table 6. When to administer live attenuated rotavirus vaccination to infants exposed to immunosuppressive medications in utero*

|Antenatal drug exposure in second or third trimester|Within the first 6 months of life|After 6 months of life|
|---|---|---|
|TNFi|Give rotavirus vaccine|–|
|Rituximab|Do not give rotavirus vaccine|Give rotavirus vaccine|

* TNFi = tumor necrosis factor inhibitor. = Conditional recommendation.

* PICO = population, intervention, comparator, outcomes; RMD = rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease; VZV = varicella‐zoster virus; HPV = human papillomavirus; MTX = methotrexate; TNFi = tumor necrosis factor inhibitors; DMARDs = disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs.

† The terms ‘moderate’, ‘low’, and ‘very low’ are based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) definitions for quality of evidence. Moderate quality means that “further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.” Low quality means that “further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.” Very low quality means that “we are very uncertain about the estimate.” In the systematic review for this guideline, a judgment of moderate quality required at least some evidence from randomized controlled trials, and a judgment of low quality required at least some evidence from well‐designed observational studies with appropriate comparator groups.

‡ Indirect evidence indicates that there is evidence from other populations with RMD or other health conditions, or evidence that does not fully address the comparison specified in a PICO question.
