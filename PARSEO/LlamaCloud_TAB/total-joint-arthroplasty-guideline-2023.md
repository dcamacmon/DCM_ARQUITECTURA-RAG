|Recommendation|Certainty of evidence|Based on the evidence report|Page numbers of evidence tables in the Supplementary Appendix†|
|---|---|---|---|
|In our defined population, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying arthroplasty 3 months.|Very low|1|1–7|
|In our defined population, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying arthroplasty for a trial of physical therapy.|Low|2|8–37|
|In our defined population, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying surgical treatment for a trial of NSAIDs.|Very low|3|38–46|
|In our defined population, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying surgical treatment for a trial of braces and/or ambulatory aids.|Very low|4|47–53|
|In our defined population, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying surgical treatment for a trial of intraarticular glucocorticoid injections.|Very low|5|54–63|
|In our defined population, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying surgical treatment for a trial of viscosupplementation injections.|Very low|6|64–76|
|In our defined population with a BMI of ≥50, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delaying to achieve weight reduction to a BMI of <50.|Very low|7|77–130|
|In our defined population with a BMI of 40–49, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delaying to achieve weight reduction to a BMI of <40.|Very low|8|77–130|
|In our defined population with a BMI of 35–39, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delaying to achieve weight reduction to a BMI of <35.|Very low|9|77–130|
|In our defined population with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, we conditionally recommend delaying TJA to improve glycemic control.|Very low|10|131–156|
|In our defined population with nicotine dependence, we conditionally recommend delaying TJA for nicotine use reduction/cessation.|Low|11|157–180|
|In our defined population with bone loss with deformity or severe ligamentous instability, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying TJA for optimization of non–life-threatening conditions.|There were no studies that either directly or indirectly answered our PICO question.|12|181|
|In our defined population with a neuropathic joint, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying for optimization of non–life-threatening conditions.|There were no studies that either directly or indirectly answered our PICO question.|13|181|

* The defined population is patients with radiographically moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis or osteonecrosis of the hip or knee using standard radiographic grading such as Kellgren/Lawrence or Tonnis, and for patients with moderate-to-severe pain or loss of function who have been indicated for elective total joint arthroplasty (TJA) through a shared decision-making process with their physician and have completed trials of ≥1 appropriate nonoperative therapy. BMI = body mass index; NSAIDs = nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs; PICO = population, intervention, comparator, outcomes.
