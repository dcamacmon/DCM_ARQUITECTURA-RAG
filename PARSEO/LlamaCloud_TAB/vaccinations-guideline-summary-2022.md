# Table 1. Medication management at the time of non-live attenuated vaccine administration

| |Influenza vaccination|Other non-live attenuated vaccinations|
|---|---|---|
|Methotrexate|Hold methotrexate for 2 weeks after vaccination*|Continue methotrexate|
|Rituximab|Continue rituximab**|Time vaccination for when the next rituximab dose is due, and then hold rituximab for at least 2 weeks after vaccination|
|Immunosuppressive medications other than methotrexate and rituximab|Continue immunosuppressive medication|Continue immunosuppressive medication|

*Hold only if disease activity allows. Non-rheumatology providers, e.g., general pediatricians and internists, are encouraged to give the influenza vaccination and then consult with the patient’s rheumatology provider about holding methotrexate to avoid a missed vaccination opportunity.

**Give influenza vaccination on schedule. Delay any subsequent rituximab dosing for at least 2 weeks after influenza vaccination if disease activity allows.

# Table 2. Whether to give or defer non-live attenuated vaccinations in patients taking glucocorticoids, regardless of disease activity

| |Influenza vaccination|Other non-live attenuated vaccinations|
|---|---|---|
|Prednisone ≤ 10 mg daily*|++ Give|++ Give|
|Prednisone > 10 mg and < 20 mg*|+ Give|+ Give|
|Prednisone ≥ 20 mg daily*|+ Give|+ Defer**|

*Or the equivalent dose of any other glucocorticoid formulation, or the equivalent pediatric dose.

**Defer vaccination until glucocorticoids are tapered to the equivalent of prednisone < 20 mg daily.

# Table 3. Immunosuppressive medication management at the time of live-attenuated virus vaccine administration

|Immunosuppressive medication|Hold before live-attenuated virus vaccine administration|Hold after live-attenuated virus vaccine administration|
|---|---|---|
|Glucocorticoidsᵃ|4 weeks|4 weeks|
|Methotrexate, azathioprineᵇ|4 weeks|4 weeks|
|Leflunomide, mycophenolate mofetil, calcineurin inhibitors, oral cyclophosphamide|4 weeks|4 weeks|
|JAK inhibitors|1 week|4 weeks|
|TNF, IL17, IL12/23, IL23, BAFF/BLyS inhibitors|1 dosing intervalᶜ|4 weeks|
|IL6 pathway inhibitors|1 dosing intervalᵈ|4 weeks|
|IL1 inhibitors| | |
|Anakinra|1 dosing intervalᵈ|4 weeks|
|Rilonacept|1 dosing intervalᵈ|4 weeks|
|Canakinumab|1 dosing intervalᵈ|4 weeks|
|Abatacept|1 dosing intervalᶜ|4 weeks|
|Anifrolumab|1 dosing intervalᶜ|4 weeks|
|Cyclophosphamide IV|1 dosing intervalᶜ|4 weeks|
|Rituximab|6 months|4 weeks|
|IVIGᵉ| | |
|300-400 mg/kg|8 months|4 weeks|
|1 gm/kg|10 months|4 weeks|
|2 gm/kg|11 months|4 weeks|

JAK= Janus kinase; TNF=tumor necrosis factor; IL=interleukin; IVIG= intravenous immunoglobulin G; IV = intravenous

a. for patients taking the equivalent of prednisone &lt; 20 mg/day or &lt; 2 mg/kg/day for patients weighing &lt; 10 kg, or alternate-day glucocorticoid therapy (i.e., “low level immunosuppression” (14, 68), these low doses can be continued if vaccination is critical and the risk of a disease flare or adrenal insufficiency off glucocorticoids is high.

b. for patients taking methotrexate ≤ 0.4 mg/kg/week or azathioprine ≤ 3 mg/kg/day (“low level” immunosuppression” (14, 68), hold times can be shortened if vaccination is critical and the risk of a disease flare off immunosuppression is high.

c. for medications with more than one FDA-approved dosing interval, the longest interval should be chosen (e.g., hold subcutaneous adalimumab for 2 weeks although it can be dosed every 1 or every 2 weeks).

d. In children with autoinflammatory disorders or systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis in whom the risk of disease flare if biologic DMARDs are held is very high, shorter hold times can be considered if live-attenuated vaccination is critical.

e. the recommendation to hold IVIG prior to vaccination is designed to enhance vaccine efficacy, not safety. In some situations, such as during a measles outbreak, earlier vaccination would be preferred over delay.

# When to administer live-attenuated rotavirus vaccination to infants exposed to immunosuppressive medications in utero

|Antenatal drug exposure in second or third trimester|Within the first 6 months of life|After 6 months of life|
|---|---|---|
|TNF inhibitor|Give rotavirus vaccine| |
|Rituximab|Do not give rotavirus vaccine|Give rotavirus vaccine|
