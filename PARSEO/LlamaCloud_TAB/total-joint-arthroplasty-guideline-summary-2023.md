|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| In our defined population, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying arthroplasty three months. | Very low                 |
| In our defined population, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying arthroplasty for a trial of physical therapy. | Low                       |
| In our defined population, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying surgical treatment for a trial of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). | Very low                 |
| In our defined population, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying surgical treatment for a trial of braces and/or ambulatory aids. | Very low                 |
| In our defined population, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying surgical treatment for a trial of intra-articular glucocorticoid injections. | Very low                 |
| In our defined population, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying surgical treatment for a trial of viscosupplementation injections. | Very low                 |
| In our defined population with body mass index (BMI) > 50, we conditionally recommend proceeding to surgery without delay to achieve weight reduction to BMI < 50. | Very low                 |
| In our defined population with body mass index (BMI) 40 - 49, we conditionally recommend proceeding to surgery without delay to achieve weight reduction to BMI < 40. | Very low                 |
| In our defined population with body mass index (BMI) 35 - 39, we conditionally recommend proceeding to surgery without delay to achieve weight reduction to BMI < 35. | Very low                 |
| In our defined population with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, we conditionally recommend delaying TJA to improve glycemic control. | Very low                 |
| In our defined population with nicotine dependence, we conditionally recommend delaying arthroplasty for nicotine use reduction/cessation. | Low                       |
| In our defined population with bone loss with deformity or severe ligamentous instability, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying arthroplasty for optimization of non-life-threatening conditions. | There were no studies that either directly or indirectly answered our PICO question. |
| In our defined population with a neuropathic joint, we conditionally recommend proceeding to TJA without delay over delaying for optimization of non-life-threatening conditions. | There were no studies that either directly or indirectly answered our PICO question. |
