# Table 1. Definitions of key terms*

|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|Active disease|Disease causing symptoms at an unacceptably bothersome level to the patient and judged by the examining clinician to be due to inflammation.|
|Stable disease|Disease that was asymptomatic or causing symptoms but at an acceptable level as reported by the patient. A minimum of 6 months was required to qualify as clinically stable.|
|Primary nonresponse|Absence of a clinically meaningful improvement in disease activity over the 3 to 6 months after treatment initiation, not related to toxicity or poor adherence.|
|Secondary nonresponse|Recurrence of ankylosing spondylitis activity, not due to treatment interruption or poor adherence, after having a sustained clinically meaningful improvement on treatment (generally, beyond the initial 6 months of treatment).|
|Conventional synthetic antirheumatic drug|Sulfasalazine, methotrexate, leflunomide, apremilast, thalidomide, pamidronate.|
|Biosimilar|Biopharmaceuticals that are copies of an original biologic medication and tested to be of the same purity and potency as the original. In these recommendations, we refer only to TNFi biosimilars. Examples include infliximab-dyyb, etanercept-szzs, and adalimumab-atto.|
|TNFi|Infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, and their biosimilars.|
|TNFi monoclonal antibodies|Infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab.|
|Biologics|TNFi, abatacept, rituximab, sarilumab, tocilizumab, ustekinumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab.**|
|High-quality evidence|Studies that provide high confidence in the effect estimate, and new data from future studies are thought unlikely to change the effect.|
|Moderate-quality evidence|Studies that provide confidence that the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate but could be substantially different.|
|Low-quality evidence|Studies that provide limited confidence about the effect, and the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate.|
|Very low-quality evidence|Studies that provide very little certainty about the effect, and the true effect may be quite different from the estimate.|
|Strong recommendation|Action should be favored in almost all patients, usually requiring high-quality evidence, high confidence that future research will not alter the conclusion, AND an assessment that the desirable effects of the intervention outweigh the undesirable effects. Should not be taken to imply that the intervention has large clinical benefits.|
|Conditional recommendation|Action should be followed in only selected cases, often limited by low-quality evidence, OR when the desirable and undesirable consequences of an intervention are more balanced, OR if patients’ preferences for the intervention are thought to vary widely.|
|Patient preferences|Beliefs and expectations regarding potential benefits and harms of treatment and how these relate to an individual’s goals for health and life.|
|Shared decision-making|The process by which a patient and clinician arrive at an individualized treatment decision based on an understanding of the potential benefits and risks of available treatment options and of a patient’s values and preferences.|
