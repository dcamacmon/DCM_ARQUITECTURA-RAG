| **Guiding Principles**                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| RA requires early evaluation, diagnosis, and management.                                                                                       |
| Treatment decisions should follow a shared decision-making process.                                                                            |
| Treatment decisions should be reevaluated within a minimum of 3 months based on efficacy and tolerability of the DMARD(s) chosen.               |
| Disease activity levels refer to those calculated using RA disease activity measures endorsed by the ACR (10).                                   |
| Recommendations are intended for the general RA patient population and assume that patients do not have contraindications to the options under consideration. |
| Recommendations are limited to DMARDs approved by the US FDA for treatment of RA.                                                                |
| csDMARDs: hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, leflunomide.                                                                         |
| bDMARDs: TNF inhibitors (etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol), T cell costimulatory inhibitor (abatacept), IL-6 receptor inhibitors (tocilizumab, sarilumab), anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab)† |
| tsDMARDs: JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib).                                                                               |
| Triple therapy refers to hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, and either methotrexate or leflunomide.                                              |
| Serious infection refers to an infection requiring intravenous antibiotics or hospitalization.                                                  |
| Biosimilars are considered equivalent to FDA-approved originator bDMARDs.                                                                      |
| Recommendations referring to bDMARDs exclude rituximab unless patients have had an inadequate response to TNF inhibitors (in order to be consistent with FDA approval) or have a history of lymphoproliferative disorder for which rituximab is an approved therapy. |
| Treat-to-target refers to a systematic approach involving frequent monitoring of disease activity using validated instruments and modification of treatment to minimize disease activity with the goal of reaching a predefined target (low disease activity or remission). |
| Target refers to low disease activity or remission.                                                                                            |
| Recommendations specify that patients be at target (low disease activity or remission) for at least 6 months prior to tapering.                  |
| Dose reduction refers to lowering the dose or increasing the dosing interval of a DMARD. Gradual discontinuation of a DMARD is defined as gradually lowering the dose of a DMARD and subsequently stopping it. |
