# 2022 American College of Rheumatology Guideline for the Prevention and Treatment of Glucocorticoid-Induced Osteoporosis

# Guideline Summary

Revised July 9, 2023

A panel of adult and pediatric rheumatologists and endocrinologists updated the systematic literature review and included currently available medications for the prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid (GC)-induced osteoporosis. A patient panel was included in this update.

Similar to the 2017 guideline, we recommend risk stratifying patients as being at low, moderate, or high risk of fracture (Adults ≥40 years, FRAX® 10-year probability of major osteoporotic fracture <10%, 10-19%, or ≥20% respectively). We added a very high risk category (prior osteoporotic fracture(s) or bone mineral density (BMD) T score ≤ -3.5 or FRAX (GC-adjusted) 10-year risk of MOF ≥30% or hip ≥4.5% or high GC ≥30 mg/day for >30 days or cumulative doses ≥5 g/year. These cut points were used to stratify PICO questions and weigh potential benefits versus harms, when considering osteoporosis (OP) therapy.

For all adults initiating or continuing GC therapy ≥2.5mg/day for >3 months, who have never had fracture risk assessment or been treated with OP therapy, initial clinical fracture risk assessment is strongly recommended over no assessment. Clinical fracture risk factor assessment includes the dose, duration, and pattern of GC use, alcohol use, smoking history, hypogonadism, history of prior fractures, low body weight, significant weight loss, parental history of hip fracture, fall history, thyroid disease, hyperparathyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, malabsorption, chronic liver disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and height loss. If available, BMD testing with VFA or spinal x-ray is recommended as soon as possible after starting GC therapy for adults and every 1-2 years thereafter while continuing GC therapy.

A strong recommendation was made to use oral bisphosphonates (BPs) over no treatment for adults ≥40 years receiving long-term GCs, at high and very high risk for fracture, based on available fracture data in GIOP populations. Other agents including intravenous BPs, PTH/PTHrP, and denosumab (DEN) are also options and are conditionally recommended given lack of fracture prevention data in GIOP populations. For adults at high risk, we conditionally recommended DEN or PTH/PTHrP over BP. For adults at very high risk, we conditionally recommended PTH/PTHrP over antiresorptives (BP, DEN). Raloxifene (RAL) and romosozumab (ROM) may be used in selected patients, after careful consideration of potential harms including thrombosis, stroke, and cardiovascular events.

# Osteoporosis Medications for Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease or Following Renal Transplant

|Medication|We strongly recommend|We conditionally recommend|
|---|---|---|
|Bisphosphonates (BP)|Treatment for those at moderate, high or very high risk of fracture.|Treatment for those at moderate or very high risk of fracture with oral or IV BP, PTH/PTHrP or DEN.|
|Alendronate (oral)|We strongly recommend oral BP over no treatment in high and very high fracture risk due to fracture reduction in GIOP.| |
|Risedronate (oral)| | |
|Ibandronate (oral/IV)| | |
|Zoledronic acid (IV)| |We conditionally recommend PTH/PTHrP over anti-resorptives in patients at very high risk of fracture.|
|PTH & PTHrP Agonists|Teriparatide (TER)|We conditionally recommend DEN or PTH/PTHrP over oral and IV BP in high risk of fracture.|
|Abaloparatide (ABL)| | |
|Anti-RANKL|Denosumab (DEN)| |
|Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator|We conditionally recommend IV BP, ROM, RAL over no treatment in high and very high risk of fracture.| |
|Raloxifene (RAL)| | |
|Anti-sclerostin|Romosozumab (ROM)|In moderate risk, we conditionally recommend BP, DEN, or PTH/PTHrP in no preferred order among these agents.|

Except in patients intolerant of other agents, we conditionally recommend against RAL due to harms of VTE and fatal stroke or ROM due to uncertain harms with increased myocardial infarction, stroke and death.

BP = bisphosphonate; PTH = parathyroid hormone; PTHrP = PTH-related protein; RANKL = Receptor activator of NF-κβ-Ligand; BMD = bone mineral density; GC= glucocorticoid; FRAX® = https://www.shef.ac.uk/FRAX/Tool.jsp; MOF = major osteoporotic fracture; * FRAX® GC correction example: if hip fracture risk is 2.0% multiply by 1.2 for adjusted risk = 2.4%; $ = Use with caution in women who may become pregnant due to higher potency and longer half-life in fetal bones; % Avoid in young adults with open growth plates; & Use with caution in women of child bearing potential due to potential fetal harm. Avoid pregnancy for 5 months after last dose.

Bisphosphonates should generally not be used in patients with an eGFR < 35 ml/min. When eGFR is < 35 ml/min, the risk of renal osteodystrophy, including adynamic bone disease, osteomalacia, osteitis fibrosa.

cystica and mixed uremic osteodystrophy, is increased. As such, metabolic bone disease expert evaluation for chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD) is conditionally recommended to exclude these conditions. Hyperparathyroidism should also be assessed. Once excluded, no dose adjustment is needed when prescribing DEN, PTH/PTHrP, or romosozumab (ROM).

We conditionally recommend treating with an oral or IV BP.

GIOP = Glucocorticoid-induced OP, BMP = Bone mineral density, GC = glucocorticoids, BP = bisphosphonate, IV = intravenous, DEN = denosumab, PTH/PTHrP = parathyroid hormone/ parathyroid hormone related protein, RAL = raloxifene, ROM = romosozumab, OP = OP; PICO = Patients, intervention, comparison, outcome; CAL/VIT D/LM = calcium/ vitamin D/ lifestyle modifications; # strong recommendation based on fracture data, $ conditional due to lack of fracture data, % who are not planning on pregnancy during the OP treatment period or are using effective birth control if sexually active; CAL = calcium; CVD = cardiovascular disease; OP = osteoporosis; PICO = Patients, intervention, comparison, outcome; GIOP = Glucocorticoid-induced OP; U.S. RDA = United States Recommended Dietary Allowances; CKD-MBD = chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder; *includes osteomalacia, adynamic bone disease, osteitis fibrosa cystica, mixed uremic osteodystrophy.

This updated guideline includes recommendations on abaloparatide (PTHrP) and romosozumab (ROM), which are newly available since the 2017 guideline. It also addresses sequential therapy, which was not addressed in the past. Patients should know that osteoporosis therapy with denosumab (DEN), teriparatide (PTH), PTHrP, or ROM will need sequential osteoporosis therapy to prevent bone loss after these drugs are discontinued. Recommendations for sequential therapies are based in part on initial study designs, long term follow-up studies, and new clinical trials. Patients completing a course of DEN should transition to 1-2 years of a BP. Patients completing a course of PTH, PTHrP, or ROM need to transition to a BP or DEN. Discontinuation of DEN after two or more doses has been associated with rapid bone loss and development of new vertebral compression fractures as soon as 7-9 months after the last dose. As such, BP therapy is recommended beginning at 6-7 months after the last dose of DEN. The precise timing, dose and duration of BP use after DEN cessation is under study, but treatment for at least 1 year seems prudent, until additional research is available. Stopping PTH/PTHrP without transition to another therapy can also result in bone loss, which can be prevented by institution of oral or IV BP or DEN. Stopping ROM without transition to another therapy can result in bone loss, which can be prevented by the institution of oral or IV BP.
