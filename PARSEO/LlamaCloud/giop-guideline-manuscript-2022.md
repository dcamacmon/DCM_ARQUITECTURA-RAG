Guidelines and recommendations developed and/or endorsed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) are intended to provide guidance for patterns of practice and not to dictate the care of a particular patient. The ACR considers adherence to the recommendations within this guideline to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the clinician in light of each patient’s individual circumstances. Guidelines and recommendations are intended to promote beneficial or desirable outcomes but cannot guarantee any specific outcome. Guidelines and recommendations developed and endorsed by the ACR are subject to periodic revision as warranted by the evolution of medical knowledge, technology, and practice. ACR recommendations are not intended to dictate payment or insurance decisions, and drug formularies or other third-party analyses that cite ACR guidelines should state this. These recommendations cannot adequately convey all uncertainties and nuances of patient care.

# Objective

The objective is to update recommendations for prevention and treatment of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) for patients with rheumatic or nonrheumatic conditions receiving >3 months treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs) ≥2.5 mg daily.

# Methods

An updated systematic literature review was performed for clinical questions on nonpharmacologic, pharmacologic treatments, discontinuation of medications, and sequential therapy. Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach was used to rate the certainty of evidence. A Voting Panel achieved ≥70% consensus on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of recommendations.

# Results

For adults beginning or continuing >3 months of GC treatment, we strongly recommend as soon as possible after initiation of GCs, initial assessment of fracture risks with clinical fracture assessment, bone mineral density with vertebral fracture assessment or spinal x-ray, and Fracture Risk Assessment Tool if ≥40 years old. For adults at medium, high, or very high fracture risk, we strongly recommend pharmacologic treatment. Choice of oral or intravenous bisphosphonates, denosumab, or parathyroid hormone analogs should be made by shared decision-making. Anabolic agents are conditionally recommended as initial therapy for those with high and very high fracture risk. Recommendations are made for special populations, including children, people with organ transplants, people who may become pregnant, and people receiving very high-dose GC treatment. New recommendations for both discontinuation of osteoporosis therapy and sequential therapies are included.

# Conclusion

This guideline provides direction for clinicians and patients making treatment decisions for management of GIOP. These recommendations should not be used to limit or deny access to therapies.

# INTRODUCTION

Glucocorticoids (GCs) remain a common therapeutic modality for patients with a variety of diseases. Prevention of GC-induced bone loss and fractures has been a focus of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) for many years because patients with osteoporotic fractures have increased risk of morbidity and mortality (1–4). It is estimated that 1% of the US population is treated with long-term GCs (5). GC doses ≥2.5 mg/day increase fracture at both the spine and hip, and GC <2.5 mg/day increase the risk of spinal fractures (6). Both high daily (≥30 mg/day) and high cumulative (≥5 g/year) doses of GCs further increase the risk of fragility fractures, with peak incidence at 12 months (7–11). The highest rate of bone loss occurs within the first 3 to 6 months of GC treatment, due to early osteoclast activation followed by decreased osteoblast proliferation and increased apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes (12). In children, GCs adversely affect bone strength, growth, and peak bone mass, with increased fracture risk (11,13–15). However, children (16) and young adults often regain lost bone when GCs are discontinued (17).

Despite increasing treatment options to prevent and treat glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP), many GC-treated patients are not evaluated or treated, resulting in preventable fractures (18,19). Risk calculators provide estimates of the 10-year risk of major osteoporotic fractures (MOFs) and hip fractures among individuals ≥40 years of age, with adjustment for GC doses >7.5 mg/day or <2.5 mg/day in some calculators (20–22). Of note, the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) is not validated for adults <40 years. These calculators underestimate fracture risk for patients on very high doses of GC therapy (eg, ≥ 30 mg/day) and do not adequately include frailty, multiple fractures, or fall history.

The ACR first published recommendations for prevention and treatment of GIOP in 1996 (23). ACR updated these guidelines in 2001, 2010, and 2017 as new techniques for assessing fracture risk, risk factors, and therapies became available (23–26). This guideline updated the literature search from April 2016, through January 24, 2022, and it includes two medications newly US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for OP treatment since the 2017 guideline.

# METHODS

This guideline follows the ACR guideline development process and ACR policy guiding management of conflicts of interest and disclosures (https://www.rheumatology.org/Practice-Quality/Clinical-Support/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines), including use of Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology (27,28) and adherence to Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) criteria (29). Supplementary Appendix 1, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25240/abstract, includes a detailed description of the methods. Briefly, the Core Leadership Team (MBH, LR, MID, HAF, GG, SU) reviewed the 2017 ACR GIOP guideline clinical Patient/Intervention/Comparator/Outcomes (PICO) questions, modified and drafted new PICO questions in topic areas not covered previously (eg, abaloparatide, romosozumab, combination and sequential therapy) (see Supplementary Appendix 2, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25240/abstract). The Literature Review Team updated the systematic literature reviews for each of the previous PICO questions and/or performed new ones among individuals ≥40 years of age, with adjustment for GC doses >7.5 mg/day or <2.5 mg/day in some calculators (20–22). The resulting evidence was reviewed, and recommendations were formulated and voted on by an expert Voting Panel. A virtual Patient Panel of three patients with GIOP and one parent of a child treated with GCs reviewed the evidence with a co-principal investigator (LR) and provided patient perspectives and preferences for consideration by the Voting Panel. Voting Panel consensus required ≥70% agreement on both direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation. Rosters of the Core Leadership Team, this article is published simultaneously in Arthritis & Rheumatology.

# ACR GUIDELINE FOR PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF GIOP

Literature Review Team, Voting Panel, and Patient Panel are included in Supplementary Appendix 4, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25240/abstract. This study did not involve human subjects and, therefore, approval from Human Studies Committees was not required.

# RECOMMENDATIONS

# How to interpret the recommendations

According to GRADE, a strong recommendation is usually supported by moderate- to high-certainty evidence, including randomized control trials, the recommended course of action would apply to all or almost all patients, and there is high confidence that the benefits of the intervention clearly outweigh the harms (or vice versa). In rare instances, a strong recommendation or best practices may be made with very-low certainty evidence if the recommendation is considered benign, low cost, and without harms.

A conditional recommendation is supported by lower certainty evidence, has uncertainty regarding the balance of benefits and harms, is sensitive to individual patient preferences, or has costs expected to impact the decision. Thus, conditional recommendations warrant shared decision-making with the patient. Notably, most evidence reviewed in this guideline is downgraded for indirectness because 1) identified studies in GIOP rely on a surrogate fracture risk marker, bone mineral density (BMD), because they were not powered for fracture outcomes and 2) available fracture data were exclusively or predominantly from general osteoporosis (OP) studies.

# Key recommendations

1. As soon as possible after initiation of ≥2.5 mg/day GC treatment for >3 months, screening for fracture risk in patients ≥40 years of age should be assessed by using FRAX and by performing BMD using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) with vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) testing or spinal x-rays. BMD with VFA testing or spinal x-ray is advised in patients <40 years, as FRAX is not validated in this population.
2. Adequate age-appropriate dietary and supplemental intake of calcium and vitamin D, weight-bearing exercise, and avoidance of smoking and excessive alcohol intake is encouraged for all patients receiving GCs.
3. All adult patients with medium, high, or very high fracture risk should be offered OP therapy.
4. Oral bisphosphonates (BP) are strongly recommended over no treatment in high or very high fracture risk adults.
5. For adults with very high fracture risk, anabolic agents (parathyroid hormone [PTH] and PTH-related protein [PTHrP]) are conditionally recommended over antiresorptive agents (BP or denosumab [DEN]).
6. In adults ≥40 years of age at high risk of fracture, DEN or PTH/PTHrP are conditionally recommended over BP.
7. In adults at moderate risk of fracture, oral or intravenous (IV) BP, DEN, and PTH/PTHrP are conditionally recommended.
8. Include in decision-making that sequential OP treatment is recommended to prevent rebound bone loss and vertebral fractures after discontinuation of DEN, romosozumab, and PTH/PTHrP.

# Recommendations for fracture risk assessment

For all adults (≥18 years old) initiating or continuing GC therapy ≥2.5 mg/day for >3 months, we strongly recommend initial clinical fracture risk assessment including symptomatic and asymptomatic fracture history, FRAX (age ≥40 only), and BMD with VFA or spine x-rays over no assessment.

These strong recommendations are based on good clinical practice and the need for clinicians to risk stratify patients beginning or continuing GC therapy, despite the low certainty of the evidence. Initial assessment should occur as soon as possible within 6 months of GC therapy initiation. Clinical fracture risk assessment includes dose, duration, and pattern of GC use, alcohol use, smoking history, hypogonadism, history of prior fractures (traumatic, fragility, asymptomatic), low body weight, significant weight loss, parental history of hip fracture, fall history, thyroid disease, hyperparathyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, malabsorption, chronic liver disease, and inflammatory bowel disease.

BMD with VFA or spinal x-rays are strongly recommended, and, for adults ≥40 years old, FRAX analysis is also recommended. If prednisone dose is >7.5 mg daily, FRAX GC correction is recommended; however, even this adjustment may not correct for very high doses of GC (≥30 mg/day). Additionally, FRAX does not incorporate falls, number or timing of fractures, or frailty that may put a person at higher risk of fracture. BMD assessment provides a strong predictor of fracture risk and serves as a baseline for reassessment because FRAX analysis is not validated for fracture risk reassessment during OP therapy. Trabecular bone score (TBS) provides a more sensitive measure of therapeutic responses to OP treatment. BMD measurement is strongly recommended for patients <40 years on GCs ≥2.5 mg/day with one or more osteoporotic risk factors. In this age group, z-scores ≤ −2.0 indicates low bone mass for age. Unlike t-scores, z-scores do not provide an indication of fracture risk.

(eg, age at diagnosis, growth, body mass index [BMI], disease severity, GC dosing, BMD, symptomatic or asymptomatic vertebral compression fractures) should be taken into account when considering assessment for OP therapy (16).

As in prior guidelines, we used risk categories of low, moderate, and high using DXA and/or FRAX assessments (see Table 1). Similar to other recent OP guidelines (33-35) (United Kingdom National Osteoporosis Guideline Group [NOGG], American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists [AACE], Brazilian Society of Endocrinology and Metabolism [SBEM]), we further identified a very high risk group with prior osteoporotic fractures, very low BMDs, very high FRAX risks, or high daily dose or high cumulative doses of glucocorticoids.

# Recommendations for reassessment of fracture risk

# Figure 2

For adults continuing chronic GC ≥2.5 mg/day and assessed as moderate, high, or very high fracture risk who are continuing OP therapy ≥1 year, we strongly recommend fracture risk re-assessment every 1 to 2 years over no risk reassessment (PICO 9.5–9.12).

Despite the low certainty of the evidence, this is a strong recommendation as good clinical practice. Reassessment allows providers to determine if patients continuing GC and OP therapy are maintaining, gaining, or losing BMD, warranting possible changes in OP therapy. Yearly BMD assessment until a stable BMD is reached may be preferred in very high fracture risk patients.

For adults stopping GC and remaining at moderate, high, or very high fracture risk, we strongly recommend continuing OP therapy (PICO 12.1–12.6).

# Recommendations for initial treatment (Table 2, exercises. All subsequent recommendations refer to adults and children beginning or continuing chronic GCs at a dose of ≥2.5 mg/day for >3 months and assume the use of calcium, vitamin D, and lifestyle modifications.

For all adults and children beginning or continuing chronic GC at a dose of ≥2.5 mg/day for >3 months, we conditionally recommended optimizing age appropriate dietary and supplemental calcium and vitamin D, in addition to lifestyle modifications (PICO 1.1–1.3, 2.1–2.3, 3.1–3.3, 4.1–4.3, 5.1–5.3, 6.1–6.3, 7.1–7.4).

For adults ≥40 years with high or very high fracture risk, we strongly recommended treatment with OP therapy over treatment with calcium and vitamin D alone (PICO 1).

For adults ≥40 years with very high fracture risk, we conditionally recommend PTH/PTHrP over anti-resorptives (BP or DEN) (PICO 1.13c, 1.14c, 1.15c, 1.18c, 1.19c, 1.20c).

Compared to alendronate, teriparatide increased lumbar and hip BMD and decreased vertebral but not nonvertebral fractures at 36 months in GIOP (37,38). Bone anabolic effect is blunted when treatment follows anti-resorptive therapy.

For adults ≥40 years with high or very high fracture risk, we strongly recommended oral BP (16) over no treatment (PICO 1).

A strong recommendation for oral BP is based on studies showing a reduction in total and vertebral fractures at 24 months and increased hip and lumbar spine BMD compared to calcium and vitamin D alone in GIOP (evidence report, Appendix S3, page 16).

For adults ≥40 years with high fracture risk, we conditionally recommend PTH/PTHrP or DEN over BP (PICO 1.4c–1.28.c).

For adults ≥40 years with high fracture risk, we conditionally recommend IV or oral BP, PTH/PTHrP, or DEN over Raloxifene (RAL) or Romosozumab (ROM) (PICO 1.4c–1.28.c).

High-certainty evidence indicates that oral BP prevents vertebral fractures in GIOP (39) and warrants a strong recommendation for use here. Compared to oral BP, PTH is superior at increasing BMD 24 and 36 months and prevented vertebral fractures at 36 months (37).

In the very high risk group, providers may recommend PTH/PTHrP as initial treatment because anabolism is blunted in patients previously treated with BP (40). IV BP and DEN GIOP trials have not been powered to detect reductions of GIOP fractures and instead use a surrogate endpoint of BMD changes (41–43).

However, the relationship between increases in BMD and a decrease in vertebral fractures is inconsistent and may account for only 25% of overall reduction in fracture risk (44). Evidence for fracture reduction of PTHrP, DEN, RAL, and ROM, and the panel recommends initial treatment choice be informed by patient co-morbidities and preferences regarding costs, burden of injections, and the need for sequential therapy (48).

# ACR GUIDELINE FOR PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF GIOP

In adults ≥40 years with high and very high fracture risk, we conditionally recommend against using multiple OP therapies at the same time (PICO 1.29–1.35).

Very low level evidence does not support using combination therapy (eg, PTH/PTHrP and DEN, PTH/PTHrP and BP) in GIOP. In patients with postmenopausal OP, studies have shown synergistic increases in BMD with combination of PTH with IV BP (49), PTH with RAL (50), and PTH and DEN (51). However, based on the added cost, the possibility of greater side effects, and the lack of fracture evidence, combination therapy is not currently recommended.

For all adults with moderate fracture risk, we conditionally recommend oral or IV BP, PTH/PTHrP, or DEN over no treatment (PICO 1.4b–1.28.b, 2.4b,c–2.17b,c).

In all adults with moderate fracture risk, we conditionally recommend against ROM and RAL therapies except in those intolerant of other OP medications, due to possible life-threatening harms, including thrombosis, fatal stroke, major cardiovascular events, and death (PICO 1.6b, 1.10b, 1.12b, 1.16b, 1.17b, 1.21b, 1.22b, 1.23b, 1.24b, 1.25b, 1.28b, 2.9, 2.14, 2.18, 2.21).

The relative risk for vertebral fracture was 14 and for hip fractures was 3 with a dose of ≥30 mg per day and ≥ 5 g of cumulative use (10).

Multiple studies have shown that 12 months of ROM followed by an anti-resorptive agent (BP or DEN) for 12 month prevents fractures in patients with postmenopausal OP when compared to anti-resorptive agent only (52–54). There is uncertainty concerning the cardiovascular risk, including myocardial infarction, stroke, and death related to ROM (47,55). However, until longer-term pharmacovigilance data become available, ROM should not be started in patients with a myocardial infarction or stroke within 12 months.

Shared decision-making between patients and clinicians is needed to determine if benefits outweigh the risks in patients with other cardiovascular risk factors that may be untreated including hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and smoking. For RAL, a meta-analysis of nine trials (24,523 postmenopausal women) found that raloxifene was associated with an increased risk of DVT and PE (odds ratio [OR] 1.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1–2.1 and OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.0–3.5, respectively) (56). In the Raloxifene use for the heart (RUTH) trial, RAL were not associated with overall stroke risk but was associated with fatal stroke (59 vs 39 events, hazard ratio [HR] 1.49, 95% CI 1.0–2.2, absolute risk increase of 0.7 per 1000 woman-years) compared with placebo (46).

In adults with low fracture risk, we strongly recommend against adding oral or IV BP, PTH/PTHrP, RAL, DEN, or ROM (PICO 1.4a–1.28a).

Adults <40 years have low fracture risk and have significant capacity to rebuild BMD losses induced by chronic GC therapy. OP therapy should not be started in this low-risk group (17,57). This strong recommendation is based on low certainty evidence of anti-fracture benefit in this low fracture risk group, coupled with clear potential harms such as osteonecrosis of the jaw (BP, DEN, ROM), atypical femur fractures (BP, DEN, ROM), PE, DVT, and fatal stroke (RAL), myocardial infarction, stroke, and death.

For adults with solid organ transplants and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥35 mL/min who are continuing chronic GC treatment, we conditionally recommend treatment with BP, DEN, PTH/PTHrP, or RAL, based on individual patient factors over no treatment (PICO 5.4-5.26). In this solid organ transplant population, we conditionally recommend against using ROM due to potential harms in this population (PICO 5.9, 5.21, 5.16).

# HUMPHREY ET AL

This group of patients is typically considered at increased risk of fracture regardless of BMD, due to the known risk of OP associated with solid organ transplantation and anti-rejection medications. The overall certainty of evidence for treatment in this population is low, and numerous potentially influential individual patient factors need to be weighed when selecting treatment.

# Recommendations for initial treatment failure

For adults continuing GC treatment who have had an osteoporotic fracture ≥12 months after starting OP therapy, or who have had a significant loss of BMD (eg, greater than the least significant change per their DXA machine) after 1 to 2 years of OP treatment, we conditionally recommend changing to another class of OP medication over not switching the class of OP medication (PICO 10.1–10.9).

In patients with stage IV and V CKD, renal osteodystrophy, including adynamic bone disease, osteomalacia, osteitis fibrosa cystica, and mixed uremic osteodystrophy, is nearly universal (59). Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, intact PTH, and bone biopsy may exclude renal osteodystrophy. BP should generally not be used if eGFR <35 mL/min. Once renal osteodystrophy and hyperparathyroidism is excluded, no dose adjustment is needed when prescribing DEN, PTH/PTHrP, or ROM. However, if eGFR is <30 mL/min, DEN is not contraindicated but induces prolonged and more severe hypocalcemia (60).

The panel recommended that patients without hyperparathyroidism and eGFR≥30 mL/min could use vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) instead of biologically active forms of vitamin D (calcitriol, paricalticol, or doxercalciferol). Patients with GFR <30 mL/min might require biologically active VitD to maintain neutral calcium balance.

# Recommendations for treatment when GC are discontinued

For children and youth ages 4 to 17 years treated with GCs for >3 months who are at low or moderate risk for fracture, optimization of age-appropriate dietary and supplemental calcium and vitamin D to fulfill the Recommended Daily Allowance is conditionally recommended in addition to an exercise program. We conditionally recommend against starting OP therapy due to the low risk of osteoporotic fractures in children and youth ages 4 to 17 years (PICO 7.1a–7.5a).

For children and youth ages 4 to 17 years with an osteoporotic fracture who are continuing treatment with chronic GC at a dose of ≥0.1 mg/kg/day for >3 months, treating with an oral or IV BP is conditionally recommended over no treatment (PICO 7.1b-7.2.b). This conditional recommendation to treat with oral or IV BP to prevent recurrent fractures is based on low-certainty evidence.

Depending on the specific disease or cause of pediatric OP, there is uncertainty about when and how to screen, and depending on the guidelines, it requires a history of clinically significant fracture(s), defined as ≥1 vertebral fractures, ≥2 long bone fractures prior to age 10 years, or ≥3 long bone fractures up to age 19 years (61,62). Twelve percent of children with rheumatic conditions on chronic GC averaging doses of 0.94 ± 0.84 mg/kg/day for 6 months who then tapered to 0.06 ± 0.12 mg/kg/day between 30 months and 36 months had vertebral fracture in the past.

For adults ≥40 years discontinuing GC therapy and continuing to be at high risk of fracture (BMD t-score ≤−2.5, or history of a fragility fracture occurring after ≥12 months of therapy), we conditionally recommend continuing current OP therapy or switching to another class of OP medication (PICO 13.5–13.6).

For adults ≥40 years continuing chronic GC who discontinue DEN, we strongly recommend starting an anti-resorptive over not starting OP medication (PICO 13.1, 13.3, 13.5).

DEN remains effective at longer than 10 years in patients with postmenopausal OP. However, discontinuation of DEN after two or more doses has been associated with rapid loss of BMD and development of new vertebral compression fractures as soon as 7 to 9 months after the last DEN dose. As such, 6 to 9 months after the last dose of DEN, BP or ROM therapy is recommended (41,42). The precise timing, dose, and duration of BP or ROM use after DEN cessation is still under study, but treatment for at least 1 year with an oral BP or 1 to 2 years of IV BP seems prudent, until additional research is available.

# HUMPHREY ET AL

(69,71,72). If ROM is used after DEN, then it must be followed with a course of BP.

For adults ≥40 years discontinuing chronic GC treatment who have completed a course of a PTH/PTHrP, we conditionally recommend starting BP over not starting an OP medication (PICO 13.4, 13.6).

Discontinuation of PTH/PTHrP medication may lead to gradual loss of bone gained over 12 to 18 months, which can be prevented by treatment with BP or DEN (73). If DEN is used sequentially after discontinuation of PTH/PTHrP, then a BP should be started at the completion of DEN therapy (Figure 4). Therefore, BP therapy is recommended after discontinuation of PTH/PTHrP.

# DISCUSSION

The objective of this updated ACR guideline for the prevention and treatment of GIOP (25) is to aid clinicians who prescribe GC, across all specialties, to best identify GC-treated patients who would benefit from prevention and treatment of GIOP. The overall goal is to reduce the number of fractures and their adverse consequences in this patient population, while minimizing harm due to medications. Fractures, especially hip and vertebral fractures, are associated with increased mortality, and patients frequently do not return to their baseline mobility (2,4,74). This guideline now addresses several new areas compared to the 2017 guideline: 1) Previously only fracture data were considered; with this guideline, both fracture reduction and BMD outcomes were considered because most GIOP studies are not powered for fracture outcomes (however, if fracture outcomes were not available, BMD data were evaluated and evidence downgraded to very low certainty); 2) a very high fracture risk category was added; 3) a preference for anabolic agent as initial OP therapy in very high fracture risk was made; 4) a need for sequential therapy after DEN, ROM, and PTH/PTHrP was made; and 5) we recommended the choice of therapies be based on clinician and patient preferences and comorbidities, rather than rank ordering the available OP therapies.

We risk stratified patients as low, moderate, high or very high risk of fracture based on FRAX 10-year probability and DXA t- or z-scores (Table 1). Similar to other organizational postmenopausal OP guidelines (AACE, SBEM, UK, and National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF)) (33–35), we have now included a very high fracture risk category (prior OP fracture(s) or BMD t-score ≤−3.5 or FRAX (GC-Adjusted) 10-year risk of MOF ≥30% or hip ≥4.5% or high GC ≥30 mg/day for >30 days or cumulative doses ≥5 g/year) (Figures 2, 3, and 5). These cut points were used to stratify PICO questions and weigh potential benefits versus harms of OP therapy.

For prednisone-equivalent doses >7.5 mg/day, a FRAX GC correction is recommended and is achieved by multiplying the risk of MOF by 1.15 and the risk of hip fractures by 1.2. Fracture risk is considered highest for GIOP-specific clinical trials and population studies. A limitation of this guideline is the lack of fracture data in GIOP-specific clinical trials and population studies.

# ACR GUIDELINE FOR PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF GIOP

General OP population clinical trials data were reviewed when GIOP data were not available. This introduced indirectness into the certainty of the evidence and imprecision in the estimate of benefits for treatment in the GIOP population. Because of these limitations, most of the recommendations in this guideline are conditional.

Future studies in the treatment of GIOP should be powered to assess fracture risk reduction. Studies should focus on children and patients with CKD stage 4 and 5. As part of risk assessment, studies should explore the use of quantitative computed tomography (CT), bone finite element analysis from CT scans, and BMD measurements from CT colonography. It would be helpful to have validated fracture prediction scores for patients aged <40 years. More studies are needed to better identify the patient populations that might benefit from combination therapy and sequential therapy in GIOP. Additional studies are required to determine the best treatment options and duration of therapy after discontinuation of DEN. In conclusion, GIOP remains a common and challenging clinical scenario that is frequently unrecognized and undertreated. By systematically synthesizing the current knowledge and available clinical trials, we have provided an updated guideline to help clinicians best care for patients requiring long-term GC use.
