# Guideline Purpose

Guidelines and recommendations developed and/or endorsed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) are intended to provide guidance for patterns of practice and not to dictate the care of a particular patient. The ACR considers adherence to the recommendations within this guideline to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the clinician in light of each patient’s individual circumstances. Guidelines and recommendations are intended to promote beneficial or desirable outcomes but cannot guarantee any specific outcome.

Guidelines and recommendations developed and endorsed by the ACR are subject to periodic revision as warranted by the evolution of medical knowledge, technology, and practice. ACR recommendations are not intended to dictate payment or insurance decisions, and drug formularies or other third-party analyses that cite ACR guidelines should state this. These recommendations cannot adequately convey all uncertainties and nuances of patient care.

The American College of Rheumatology is an independent, professional medical, and scientific society that does not guarantee, warrant, or endorse any commercial product or service.

# Objective

To develop initial American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guidelines on the use of exercise, rehabilitation, diet, and additional interventions in conjunction with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) as part of an integrative management approach for people with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

# Methods

An interprofessional guideline development group constructed clinically relevant Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) questions. A literature review team then completed a systematic literature review and applied the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to rate the certainty of evidence. An interprofessional Voting Panel (n = 20 participants) that included 3 individuals with RA achieved consensus on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of recommendations.

# Results

The Voting Panel achieved consensus on 28 recommendations for the use of integrative interventions in conjunction with DMARDs for the management of RA. Consistent engagement in exercise received a strong recommendation. Of 27 conditional recommendations, 4 pertained to exercise, 13 to rehabilitation, 3 to diet, and 7 to additional integrative interventions. These recommendations are specific to RA management, recognizing that other medical indications and general health benefits may exist for many of these interventions.

# Conclusion

This guideline provides initial ACR recommendations on integrative interventions for the management of RA to accompany DMARD treatments. The broad range of interventions included in these recommendations illustrates the importance of an interprofessional, team-based approach to RA management. The conditional nature of most recommendations requires clinicians to engage persons with RA in shared decision-making when applying these recommendations.

# INTRODUCTION

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory condition, and improved outcomes occur with early diagnosis, evaluation, and management. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has previously published pharmacologic guidelines to aid clinicians and individuals with RA (1–4). In addition to pharmacologic interventions, individuals with RA and their clinicians consider how exercise, rehabilitation, diet, and additional integrative therapies can benefit and be included in their disease management. Using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, the ACR developed this first guideline to support decision-making when using specific integrative interventions in the management of RA. The interventions considered in this guideline are defined in Table 1; the critical outcomes were pain and physical function, and for select interventions, disease activity or work outcomes. Although individuals with RA may have other indications for these interventions (e.g., comorbidities), this guideline focuses specifically on managing RA.

# METHODS

This guideline follows the ACR guideline development process and ACR policy guiding management of conflicts of interest and disclosures (https://rheumatology.org/clinical-practice-guidelines), which includes GRADE methodology (5,6) and adheres to AGREE criteria (7). Supplementary Appendix 1 (available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25117) includes a detailed description of the methods. Briefly, the Core Leadership Team (BRE, BJS, NAB, JLB, CAO, and GG) drafted clinical Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) questions with input from the rest of the guideline development group, and these were posted online for public comment (see Supplementary Appendix 2, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25117). For most questions, the critical outcomes were physical function, which refers to the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and pain. Disease activity was an additional critical outcome for questions pertaining to diet and dietary supplements. Work outcomes were additional critical outcomes for questions pertaining to vocational rehabilitation and work site evaluation and modification.

The Literature Review Team performed a systematic literature review for all PICO questions, extracted relevant study data, graded the quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, very low), and produced the evidence report (see Supplementary Appendix 3, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25117). A Patient Panel of 12 patients with varying manifestations of RA and varying experiences with the considered interventions for RA management met virtually. This panel was moderated by a member of the Core Team (JLB) and Literature Review Team (LT). The panel reviewed the evidence report (along with a summary and interpretation by the moderator) and provided patient perspectives and preferences for consideration by the Voting Panel. At a separate Voting Panel meeting held virtually, the resulting evidence was reviewed, patient perspectives considered, and recommendations formulated and voted on. Three members of the Patient Panel were also members of the Voting Panel, to ensure the Patient Panel’s perspective was considered when final decisions on the recommendations were made.

Core Leadership Team, Literature Review Team, Voting Panel, and Patient Panel are included in Supplementary Appendix 4 (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25117). The literature review did not identify any evidence to indicate fulfillment of the eligibility criteria for 29% (8 of 28) of the PICO questions.

Consensus among the Voting Panel members required ≥70% agreement on both directions (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation, as per ACR practice. According to GRADE, a recommendation is categorized as strong if the panel is very confident that the benefits of an intervention clearly outweigh the harms (or vice versa); a conditional recommendation denotes uncertainty regarding the balance of benefits and harms, such as when the evidence quality is low or very low, or when the decision is particularly sensitive to individual patient preferences, or when costs are expected to affect the decision. Thus, conditional recommendations refer to decisions in which incorporation of patient preferences and values is an essential element of shared decision-making.

# Exercise recommendations (Table 3)

We strongly recommend consistent engagement in exercise over no exercise.

We recommend consistent engagement in exercise over no exercise based on moderate certainty evidence suggesting that regular exercise results in improved physical function and pain in individuals with chronic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis.

# Table 2. Guiding principles for the integrative management of rheumatoid arthritis*

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, systemic inflammatory condition that requires early diagnosis, evaluation, and management to achieve optimal outcomes.

Rheumatoid arthritis should be treated with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and follow a treat-to-target management strategy, as detailed in the 2021 ACR Rheumatoid Arthritis Pharmacologic Treatment Guidelines (1).

Individuals with chronic diseases like rheumatoid arthritis seek many available therapies to maintain physical function, reduce pain, and improve their quality of life.

Treatment decisions should follow a shared decision-making process. Individuals with rheumatoid arthritis present with a variety of manifestations and experiences.

Optimum rheumatoid arthritis treatment outcomes are achieved through interprofessional teams providing expert patient-centered care.

Recommendations assume no contraindications to listed management strategies. Recommendations pertain to rheumatoid arthritis management. Recommendations do not pertain to clinical situations in which patients have alternative indications for listed treatments. Other general health benefits may exist for listed treatments.

# RESULTS/RECOMMENDATIONS

Twenty-eight recommendations were made based on a set of 28 PICO questions. The systematic literature review initially identified 8,994 manuscripts (see search strategies in Supplementary Appendix 5, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25117). After screening, 275 manuscripts were mapped to ≥1 PICO question.

individuals with RA. Aerobic, resistance, aquatic, and mind–body exercise were considered together in the evidence supporting this recommendation. The exercise type, frequency, intensity, and duration were not formally defined because the evidence on exercise interventions did not support such precision in the recommendation, and there is considerable variation in patient values, preferences, and access to different types of exercise. The Voting Panel and Patient Panel emphasized the importance of appropriate prescription and supervision of resistance exercise by physical therapists or other qualified exercise professionals to prevent harm.

We conditionally recommend consistent engagement in mind–body exercise over no exercise.

We recommend consistent engagement in mind–body exercise (e.g., yoga, Tai Chi, Qigong) based on very low to low certainty evidence suggesting that it results in improved physical function but no difference in pain. The recommendation is conditional because of the level of certainty of the evidence, variability in patient preferences, and variations in the cost of, access to, and burden of this type of activity.

We conditionally recommend consistent engagement in aerobic exercise over no exercise.

We recommend consistent engagement in aerobic exercise based on very low to low certainty evidence suggesting that it results in improved physical function but moderate certainty evidence suggesting there is no difference in pain. The recommendation is conditional because of the level of certainty of the evidence and recognizing that patient preferences may vary due to RA disease activity level, the presence of joint damage or deformities, comorbidities, and the cost of, access to, or burden of engaging in consistent aerobic exercise.

We conditionally recommend participation in comprehensive occupational therapy (OT) over no comprehensive OT.

We conditionally recommend participation in comprehensive physical therapy (PT) over no comprehensive PT.

We recommend consistent engagement in aquatic exercise based on low certainty evidence to indicate that it results in improvement in physical function but no difference in pain. The recommendation is conditional because of the level of certainty of the evidence, the variability in patient preferences related to comfort in engaging in water activities, and the variations in the cost of, access to, and burden of aquatic exercise.

We conditionally recommend consistent engagement in resistance exercise over no exercise.

We recommend consistent engagement in resistance exercise based on very low to low certainty evidence to indicate that it results in improvement in physical function (inferred from performance measures) and pain. The recommendation is conditional because of the level of certainty of the evidence and recognizing that patient preferences may vary due to RA disease activity level, the presence of joint damage or deformities, comorbidities, and the cost of, access to, or burden of engaging in consistent resistance exercise.

# Rehabilitation recommendations (Table 4)

|Recommendation|Certainty of evidence|Evidence Summary|page nos. in Evidence Report|
|---|---|---|---|
|We strongly recommend consistent engagement in exercise over no exercise.|Moderate|4–7|194–344|

shared decision-making approach. This recommendation applies throughout the RA disease course. Clinicians should discuss the opportunity to refer the patient to OT and/or PT early in the RA disease course, with the recognition that OT and/or PT interventions can be tailored to unique patient needs throughout the patient’s experience with RA. Access to OT and PT services (e.g., availability, insurance coverage) may be a barrier to care. Interventions in the subsequent recommendation statements are often included in comprehensive OT and/or PT services.

For patients with hand involvement, we conditionally recommend performance of hand therapy over no hand therapy exercises.

For patients with foot and/or ankle involvement, we conditionally recommend use of bracing, orthoses, and/or taping over no bracing, orthoses, and/or compression.

# ACR GUIDELINE FOR INTEGRATIVE INTERVENTIONS IN RA

For patients with knee involvement, we conditionally recommend use of bracing and/or orthoses over no bracing and/or orthoses.

We conditionally recommend use of splinting, orthoses, and/or compression among individuals with hand/wrist involvement, use of bracing, orthoses, and/or taping among individuals with foot/ankle involvement, and use of bracing and/or orthoses among individuals with knee involvement. These recommendations are based on very low certainty evidence to indicate that these approaches improve pain and physical function at the hand/wrist and foot/ankle. No studies pertaining to the use of these approaches for patients with knee involvement met the eligibility criteria. Although the Patient Panel discussed the discomfort and burden accompanying the periodic and regular use of these interventions, the Patient Panel and Voting Panel also recognized their potential to reduce pain and improve physical function. In addition, although these interventions are available without a prescription, the Voting Panel recommends their prescription and use under the guidance of an experienced occupational therapist or physical therapist to ensure appropriate item selection and fit.

We conditionally recommend use of joint protection techniques over no joint protection techniques.

We conditionally recommend use of joint protection techniques based on low certainty evidence to indicate that it results in improved pain and function. Experienced healthcare professional guidance in joint protection techniques at various stages of a patient’s experience with RA is vital for this intervention, in order to aid the patient in maintaining physical function. The Voting Panel also stressed the importance of proper patient education in joint protection techniques by occupational or physical therapists.

We conditionally recommend use of activity pacing, energy conservation, activity modification, and/or fatigue management over no activity pacing, energy conservation, activity modification, and/or fatigue management.

There was no evidence found to support the conditional recommendation that individuals with RA should use activity pacing, energy conservation, activity modification, and/or fatigue management. However, these interventions are generally safe and may help preserve physical function and manage fatigue. Proper instruction in these approaches by occupational or physical therapists (e.g., ensuring no prolonged inactivity) as well as periodic reminders to employ them were suggested by the Patient Panel and Voting Panel.

We conditionally recommend use of assistive devices over no assistive devices.

We conditionally recommend use of adaptive equipment over no adaptive equipment.

We conditionally recommend use of environmental adaptations over no environmental adaptations.

In the absence of evidence addressing recommendations for the use of assistive devices, adaptive equipment, or environmental adaptations, we conditionally recommend against adherence to a formally defined diet, other than a Mediterranean-style diet.

# Diet recommendations (Table 5)

We conditionally recommend adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet over no formally defined diet.

The Mediterranean-style diet pattern emphasizes the intake of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and olive oil and the intake of moderate amounts of low-fat dairy and fish, and limits the use of added sugars, sodium, highly processed foods, refined carbohydrates, and saturated fats. We conditionally recommend adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet based on low to moderate certainty of evidence of improvement in pain and no difference in physical function or disease activity. The recommendation is conditional because of the level of certainty of the evidence, patient preferences, and costs of, access to, and burden associated with this type of diet. The Voting Panel recognized the potential benefits of a Mediterranean-style diet for long-term health outcomes (e.g., longevity and cardiovascular disease) that are affected by RA disease activity and the evidence from studies in the general population (9,10). The expert role of a registered dietitian as a member of the interprofessional team is recognized.

We conditionally recommend against adherence to a formally defined diet, other than the Mediterranean-style diet, based on very low to moderate certainty evidence demonstrating no consistent, clinically meaningful benefit from following other formally defined diet strategies (other than a Mediterranean-style diet) on physical function, pain, or disease activity specific to RA (see Table 1). In addition to the level of certainty of the evidence, this recommendation is conditional because of the burden and costs that accompany adhering to a formally defined diet, and patient preferences are expected to differ.

We conditionally recommend following established dietary recommendations without use of dietary supplements over adding dietary supplements.

We conditionally recommend following established dietary recommendations without the use of dietary supplements for RA management. This recommendation pertains to all dietary supplements considered (as listed in Table 1) and is based on very low to moderate certainty evidence demonstrating no consistent, clinically meaningful benefit from adding dietary supplements with regard to physical function, pain, or disease activity specific to RA. The recommendation is conditional because of the level of certainty of the evidence, expected variation in patient preferences, adequacy of nutrient intake through diet, lack of regulation (e.g., by the US Food and Drug Administration), possibility of harm (e.g., interactions with medications, side effects), and costs. The Voting Panel supported a “food first” approach but recognized the role dietary supplements may serve for bone (e.g., vitamin D) and cardiovascular health (e.g., fish oil), which are particularly important in individuals with RA.

In this recommendation, established dietary recommendations refer to those produced by the US Department of Agriculture and US Department of Health and Human Services and the American Heart Association. Recommendations on folic acid supplementation in the setting of treatment with methotrexate are included in the ACR’s pharmacologic treatment guidelines.

# Body weight and weight loss

Given the broad spectrum of weight loss interventions, including lifestyle modification, commercial weight loss programs, pharmacologic therapies, and surgical interventions, the Voting Panel did not vote on recommendations regarding weight loss interventions specifically for RA management in overweight or obese people with RA. However, the Voting Panel was unanimous in its support of clinicians engaging in discussion about maintaining a healthy body weight for individuals with RA, in order to optimize long-term RA and general health outcomes. In RA, obesity is associated with higher disease activity, impairments in physical function, and poorer treatment response, in addition to poor long-term health outcomes. General population recommendations on body weight classification and weight loss strategies for those who are overweight or obese can serve as a guide for these discussions.

We conditionally recommend use of a standardized self-management program over no standardized self-management program.

We conditionally recommend that RA patients use a standardized self-management program based on low certainty evidence to indicate that it results in improved physical function and pain. The Patient Panel described how these programs can be “life changing” and can provide motivation related to several factors that contribute to quality of life, including mental wellness and psychological adaptation to disease experience. The availability of and access to these programs as well as their costs were noted as potential barriers.

We conditionally recommend use of cognitive behavioral therapy and/or mind–body approaches over no cognitive behavioral therapy and/or mind-body approaches.

We conditionally recommend use of cognitive behavioral therapy and/or mind–body approaches based on very low to low certainty evidence indicating no consistent improvement in pain and physical function (critical outcomes) but low to moderate certainty evidence of improvement in depression, anxiety, fatigue, and sleep (important outcomes) when individuals with RA use these approaches. Although these interventions are beneficial for chronic disease management, access to these interventions may be limited.

We conditionally recommend use of acupuncture over no acupuncture. We conditionally recommend use of acupuncture based on low certainty evidence indicating inconsistent improvements in pain and function. The Patient Panel generally found acupuncture to be of lower value than other considered interventions for RA management based on their disease experiences. For individuals with RA, the burden, cost, access, and invasiveness of acupuncture may impact the choice to use this intervention.

We conditionally recommend use of massage therapy over no massage therapy. We conditionally recommend use of massage therapy based on very low certainty evidence that it results in improvement of pain. Massage therapy intensity and technique may affect a patient’s experience; therefore, it is best delivered by a provider (e.g., massage therapist, physical therapist) with knowledge of and experience in treating people with RA. Burden, cost, access, and short-term duration of benefit should be considered.

We conditionally recommend use of thermal modalities over no thermal modalities. We conditionally recommend use of thermal modalities, such as cryotherapy, heat, and therapeutic ultrasound, based on very low certainty evidence indicating that it results in improvement in pain and physical function. Individuals with RA receive varying levels of benefit from thermal modalities, and patient preferences are expected to vary with regard to the choice of a thermal modality. Individuals with RA can control and administer many of these modalities at home, though others may benefit from guidance from an occupational or physical therapist.

Tobacco cessation: Due to existing clinical quality measures for tobacco use screening and cessation and the absence of studies on tobacco cessation in RA (those meeting the eligibility criteria), the Voting Panel did not make further recommendations on individual tobacco cessation interventions for the specific management of RA beyond the clinical quality measures.

The Voting Panel and Patient Panel perceived a lack of benefit from chiropractic therapy specifically for RA, and indicated that this approach carries a perceived burden and costs.

# ENGLAND ET AL

recognized the well-established harms of tobacco, including detrimental effects on RA that include higher disease severity, poorer treatment response, and increased risk of poor long-term disease outcomes (19). Because of the trust that is frequently developed between RA patients and their clinicians and the low success rate of individual tobacco cessation counseling efforts (20), there was unanimous agreement that clinicians caring for individuals with RA serve an integral role in counseling on tobacco cessation (21).

# DISCUSSION

This is the first ACR guideline on the use of exercise, rehabilitation, diet, and additional integrative interventions in conjunction with DMARDs for RA management. This guideline highlights the importance of an interprofessional healthcare team to provide optimal care to individuals with RA. The recommended interventions do not replace DMARD treatments, in accordance with existing ACR pharmacologic treatment guidelines (1), but are intended to be integrated into the comprehensive management of individuals with RA.

The recommended interventions in this new guideline, which are intended to augment DMARD therapy, were considered specifically for their efficacy in the management of RA outcomes, rather than other general health benefits or alternative medical indications. The guideline is meant to increase patient and clinician awareness, provide evidence to inform shared decision-making, improve access to the recommended interventions, and inspire much-needed future research in this area to generate higher-certainty evidence for the management of RA.

The one strong recommendation was for consistent engagement in exercise. Recommendations for exercise include multiple types (aerobic, aquatic, resistance, mind–body), which is consistent with physical activity guidelines produced by the US Department of Health and Human Services (8). The specific type, frequency, intensity, and duration of exercise should be tailored to each person with the assistance of their clinicians, considering the potential burden on and capacity of each person (22). The US recommendations on exercise and physical activity can serve as a guide to clinicians counseling patients (8). Because the symptoms and consequences of RA may impact participation (23), more personalized exercise prescription and monitoring may be needed with the assistance of physical therapists and/or clinical exercise physiologists.

Individuals with RA who currently use tobacco should be supported in their tobacco cessation journey. The limited efficacy of counseling on tobacco cessation (20) illustrates why it is critical for all members of the interprofessional care team to engage in this practice, which is an existing clinical quality measure (25). There was not sufficient evidence to establish more specific recommendations for tobacco use screening and cessation in RA.

A broad range of interventions was considered in this guideline. It is unlikely that one clinician will possess the necessary expertise in all these areas, which illustrates the importance of assembling an interprofessional healthcare team to best support individuals with RA. The Patient Panel emphasized that rheumatology clinicians (e.g., physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners) are most often their first contact for therapeutic decisions. Thus, it was important to patients that their rheumatology clinician(s) be knowledgeable about integrative therapies and help guide patients to other professionals with relevant expertise (e.g., physical and occupational therapists, dieticians, clinical).

# ACR GUIDELINE FOR INTEGRATIVE INTERVENTIONS IN RA

Exercise physiologists, psychologists, massage therapists, acupuncturists early in the disease course, so that they can be involved in shared-decision making throughout the disease course.

RA is a chronic disease that imposes considerable costs on those affected as well as increased costs to society (26,27). The recommended interventions in this guideline are variably covered by health insurance, and many of the costs become the responsibility of the individual with RA. We encourage health policymakers to advocate for insurance coverage of these interventions in order to support an integrative and comprehensive approach to the management of RA. The availability of and access to these interventions was a concern of both the Patient Panel and the Voting Panel, particularly for underserved populations. Improving access to and ensuring high-quality delivery of these interventions across diverse settings are important endeavors to support. In addition, the Voting Panel acknowledged that patients and/or clinicians may have implicit and/or explicit biases regarding interventions that may make them reluctant to recommend or use these interventions (28). While the evidence-based approach used in this guideline can help overcome such biases, clinicians should consider whether such biases may exist and work to reduce them.

The majority of recommendations were conditional in part because of low certainty evidence. Several factors contributed to the low certainty grading, including the following: 1) the limited number of studies evaluating relevant interventions; 2) lack of blinding and study attrition; 3) small sample sizes resulting in imprecision; and 4) heterogeneity of study designs (e.g., various).

# Table 7. Research agenda for the integrative management of rheumatoid arthritis

Evaluate the efﬁcacy and safety of integrative therapies for the management of rheumatoid arthritis. Initial evidence is needed in the areas of activity pacing, energy conservation, activity modiﬁcation, fatigue management, and vocational rehabilitation. Additional strong evidence from larger, well-designed studies is needed in all other areas.Determine the appropriate timing of different integrative interventions in the rheumatoid arthritis disease course.Examine the delivery, education, and implementation of integrative interventions. For example, evaluating various methods of instruction and training of joint protection and activity pacing interventions.Establish the cost-effectiveness of different integrative interventions and develop approaches for cost-effective delivery.Identify barriers to the adoption and implementation of integrative therapies. These may include variability in access, costs, and implicit and/or explicit biases.Describe the assembly of, communication between, and role delineation among the interprofessional care team delivering pharmacologic and integrative interventions.Improve access to experienced healthcare professionals who provide integrative interventions.Determine efﬁcacy and safety of integrative interventions based on rheumatoid arthritis disease manifestations and pharmacologic therapies, e.g., modifying exercise interventions based on disease activity level or diet based on disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs utilized.Tailor interventions (and their delivery) studied in the general population to individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, e.g., tobacco cessation programs, exercise programs, and weight loss.Deﬁne efﬁcacy and safety of therapies not included in this guideline such as cannabidiol, vaping, and occupational exposures and protections as well as emerging therapies such as vagal nerve stimulation.Evaluate dietary supplements (especially vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids such as “ﬁsh oil”) in the context of dietary intake. The assessment and implementation of diets should focus on being inclusive of different cultures.Develop vocational rehabilitation programs and work site modiﬁcations that improve the ability of individuals with rheumatoid arthritis to work without negative stigma in the workplace.Establish the efﬁcacy and safety of integrative therapies on extraarticular manifestations and long-term rheumatoid arthritis–related outcomes. In addition to disease activity, physical function, pain, and quality of life outcomes considered in this guideline, other outcomes that should be considered are longevity, cardiovascular disease, lung disease, cancer, osteoporosis, and infection.Develop research methodology to study integrative therapies, e.g., deﬁning an adequate control intervention. Publication of research standards for integrative therapies relevant to rheumatoid arthritis to guide research efforts.Establish dedicated funding from organizations to study integrative rheumatoid arthritis therapies and their implementation.

Sciences University (31). Different modes of delivering interventions (e.g., telehealth versus in-person) were not assessed, as this was beyond the scope of this project.

In summary, this guideline outlines initial recommendations on the management of RA with exercise, rehabilitation, diet, and additional integrative interventions. These recommendations complement existing pharmacologic treatment guidelines that instruct on the use of DMARDs and, taken together, can guide a shared decision-making approach between the individual with RA and their clinician. Interprofessional treatment teams are crucial to implementing these recommendations. The generally low-quality evidence highlights the need for well-designed studies in the area of integrative management of RA. Policy efforts are needed to ensure access to recommended interventions for individuals with RA from diverse backgrounds and settings. Together, these integrative and pharmacologic guidelines support the comprehensive management of RA in pursuit of optimal outcomes for people living with RA.
