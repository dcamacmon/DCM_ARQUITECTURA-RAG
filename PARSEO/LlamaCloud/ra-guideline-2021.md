Guidelines and recommendations developed and/or endorsed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) are intended to provide general guidance for commonly encountered clinical scenarios. The recommendations do not dictate the care for an individual patient. The ACR considers adherence to the recommendations described in this guideline to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the clinicians in light of each patient’s individual circumstances. Guidelines and recommendations are intended to promote beneficial or desirable outcomes but cannot guarantee any specific outcome.

Guidelines and recommendations developed and endorsed by the ACR are subject to periodic revision as warranted by the evolution of medical knowledge, technology, and practice. ACR recommendations are not intended to dictate payment or insurance decisions, or drug formularies or other third-party analyses. Third parties that cite ACR guidelines should state that these recommendations are not meant for this purpose. These recommendations cannot adequately convey all uncertainties and nuances of patient care.

# Objective

To develop updated guidelines for the pharmacologic management of rheumatoid arthritis.

# Methods

We developed clinically relevant population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes (PICO) questions. After conducting a systematic literature review, the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used to rate the certainty of evidence. A voting panel comprising clinicians and patients achieved consensus on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of recommendations.

# Results

The guideline addresses treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including conventional synthetic DMARDs, biologic DMARDs, and targeted synthetic DMARDs, use of glucocorticoids, and use of DMARDs in certain high-risk populations (i.e., those with liver disease, heart failure, lymphoproliferative disorders, previous serious infections, and nontuberculous mycobacterial lung disease). The guideline includes 44 recommendations (7 strong and 37 conditional).

# Conclusion

This clinical practice guideline is intended to serve as a tool to support clinician and patient decision-making. Recommendations are not prescriptive, and individual treatment decisions should be made through a shared decision-making process based on patients’ values, goals, preferences, and comorbidities.

The findings and conclusions herein are those of the authors and do not represent the official position of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This study did not involve human subjects, and therefore, approval from Human Studies Committees was not required.

# ACR GUIDELINE FOR TREATMENT OF RA

# INTRODUCTION

ACR panel developed recommendations for commonly encountered clinical scenarios (6–8). Both strong and conditional recommendations required achieving a 70% level of agreement by the voting panel. Each recommendation is qualified as being strong or conditional. In this context, strong recommendations are those for which the panel is highly confident that the recommended option favorably balances the expected benefits and risks for the majority of patients in clinical practice. In contrast, conditional recommendations are those for which the panel is less confident that the potential benefits outweigh the risks. A recommendation can be conditional either because of low or very low certainty in the evidence supporting one option over another, or because of an expectation of substantial variations in patient preferences for the options under consideration.

To support high-quality clinical care, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) regularly updates clinical practice guidelines for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with the most recent update reported in 2015 (1). The current recommendations address treatment with the following: 1) conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (csDMARDs), biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs), and targeted synthetic DMARDs (tsDMARDs); 2) glucocorticoids; and 3) use of these medications in certain high-risk populations. The use of vaccines and nonpharmacologic treatment approaches (although initially part of this project) will be covered in future ACR treatment guideline publications. For recommendations regarding pretreatment screening and routine laboratory monitoring, we refer readers to the 2008, 2012, and 2015 guidelines (1–3), with newly approved therapies following the screening process recommended for other medications in the same class. Recommendations for the perioperative management of patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery are addressed in the 2017 guideline for perioperative management (4). For recommendations regarding reproductive health, we refer readers to the 2020 ACR Guideline for the Management of Reproductive Health in Rheumatic and Musculoskeletal Diseases (5).

# METHODS

This guideline follows the ACR guideline development process and ACR policy guiding the management of conflicts of interest and disclosures (https://www.rheumatology.org/Practice-Quality/Clinical-Support/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines) (6,8), which includes GRADE methodology (6,8), and abides by the AGREE Reporting Checklist to ensure the completeness and transparency of reporting in practice guidelines (9).

elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24596/ abstract), includes a detailed description of the methods. Briefly, the core leadership team drafted clinical population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes (PICO) questions. The literature review team performed systematic literature reviews for the PICO questions, selected and evaluated individual studies and graded the quality of the body of evidence available for each outcome, and produced the evidence report that summarizes these assessments (see Supplementary Appendix 2, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at http://onlinelibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24596/ abstract).

The core team defined the critical study outcome as disease activity for most PICO questions. Because the ACR has, in a separate project, endorsed several disease activity measures for use in clinical practice, this guideline does not define levels of disease activity or the instruments a clinician should use to measure it (10). For PICO questions related to tapering, the critical outcomes were disease flare and subsequent return to the treatment target. Physical function, radiographic progression, quality of life, other patient-reported outcome measures, and adverse events were defined as important outcomes. Additional clinical outcomes were defined for PICO questions pertaining to select high-risk conditions (see Supplementary Appendix 3, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at http://onlinelibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24596/ abstract).

When available, cost-effectiveness studies were included with the evidence reports. Cost estimates (average wholesale prices) were retrieved from Lexicomp (see Supplementary Appendix 4, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at http://onlinelibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24596/ abstract). The panel considered these estimates from a societal perspective, i.e., based on the list price, and not the copay.

An in-person panel of 10 patients with RA, moderated by the project’s principal investigator, reviewed the evidence report (along with a summary and interpretation by the moderator) and provided patient perspectives for consideration by the voting panel. The voting panel (13 clinicians and 2 patients) reviewed the evidence reports and patient perspectives and voted on recommendation statements. Rosters of the core leadership, literature review team, and panel members are listed in Supplementary Appendix 5, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at http://online libr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24596/ abstract.

# 1. Guiding Principles

RA requires early evaluation, diagnosis, and management.Treatment decisions should follow a shared decision-making process.Treatment decisions should be reevaluated within a minimum of 3 months based on efficacy and tolerability of the DMARD(s) chosen.Disease activity levels refer to those calculated using RA disease activity measures endorsed by the ACR (10).Recommendations are intended for the general RA patient population and assume that patients do not have contraindications to the options under consideration.Recommendations are limited to DMARDs approved by the US FDA for treatment of RA.csDMARDs: hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, leflunomidebDMARDs: TNF inhibitors (etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol), T cell costimulatory inhibitor (abatacept), IL-6 receptor inhibitors (tocilizumab, sarilumab), anti-CD20 antibody (rituximab)†tsDMARDs: JAK inhibitors (tofacitinib, baricitinib, upadacitinib)Triple therapy refers to hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, and either methotrexate or leflunomide.Serious infection refers to an infection requiring intravenous antibiotics or hospitalization.Biosimilars are considered equivalent to FDA-approved originator bDMARDs.Recommendations referring to bDMARDs exclude rituximab unless patients have had an inadequate response to TNF inhibitors (in order to be consistent with FDA approval) or have a history of lymphoproliferative disorder for which rituximab is an approved therapy.Treat-to-target refers to a systematic approach involving frequent monitoring of disease activity using validated instruments and modification of treatment to minimize disease activity with the goal of reaching a predefined target (low disease activity or remission).Target refers to low disease activity or remission.Recommendations specify that patients be at target (low disease activity or remission) for at least 6 months prior to tapering.Dose reduction refers to lowering the dose or increasing the dosing interval of a DMARD. Gradual discontinuation of a DMARD is defined as gradually lowering the dose of a DMARD and subsequently stopping it.

* RA = rheumatoid arthritis; DMARDs = disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs; ACR = American College of Rheumatology; FDA = Food and Drug Administration; csDMARDs = conventional DMARDs; bDMARDs = biologic DMARDs; TNF = tumor necrosis factor; IL-6 = interleukin-6; tsDMARDs = targeted synthetic DMARDs.

† Anakinra was not included due to infrequent use for patients with RA.

# RESULTS/RECOMMENDATIONS

The recommendations are based on a set of 81 PICO questions. The literature review initially identified 22,971 manuscripts (for the full set of PICO questions covering both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment). After excluding 18,333 titles

and abstracts, 4,038 full-text articles were screened, of which 1,392 were excluded and 2,646 were considered for the evidence report. After full-text screening, 133 manuscripts were mapped to ≥1 PICO questions addressing pharmacologic treatment (see Supplementary Appendix 6, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24596/abstract). The literature review did not identify any evidence for 41% (n = 33) of the PICO questions.

# Recommendations for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity

# DMARD monotherapy

Methotrexate is strongly recommended over hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity. This recommendation is strongly in favor of methotrexate despite very low-certainty evidence for hydroxychloroquine and low-certainty evidence suggesting superiority of tocilizumab monotherapy (15) over methotrexate monotherapy and moderate-certainty evidence suggesting greater efficacy.

# Glucocorticoids

Initiation of a csDMARD without short-term (&lt;3 months) glucocorticoids is conditionally recommended over initiation of a csDMARD with short-term glucocorticoids for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity.

While the voting panel agreed that glucocorticoids should not be systematically prescribed, the recommendation is conditional because all members acknowledged that short-term glucocorticoids are frequently necessary to alleviate symptoms prior to the onset of action of DMARDs. Treatment with glucocorticoids should be limited to the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. The toxicity associated with glucocorticoids was judged to outweigh potential benefits.

Initiation of a csDMARD without longer-term (≥3 months) glucocorticoids is strongly recommended over initiation of a csDMARD with longer-term glucocorticoids for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity.

Although some patients may require longer-term glucocorticoids, this strong recommendation against longer-term glucocorticoid therapy is made because of its significant toxicity.

# ACR GUIDELINE FOR TREATMENT OF RA

Recommendation for patients who have been treated with csDMARDs, excluding methotrexate, and who have moderate-to-high disease activity (Table 2) the increased efﬁcacy and risks of toxicity associated with higher starting doses. This recommendation refers only to the initial pre-scribing of methotrexate and is not meant to limit further dose escalation, which often provides additional efﬁcacy (24).

Recommendations are the same as for DMARD-naive patients except for this population. The strength of the following recommendation is conditional for all bDMARDs and tsDMARDs.

Methotrexate monotherapy is conditionally recommended over the combination of methotrexate plus a bDMARD or tsDMARD for patients not tolerating oral weekly methotrexate. The recommendation is conditional because the voting panel thought that some patients who have already had persistent disease activity despite use of ≥1 csDMARD will prefer combination treatment for a more rapid response.

# Recommendations for administration of methotrexate (Table 3)

Oral methotrexate is conditionally recommended over subcutaneous methotrexate for patients initiating methotrexate. Oral administration is preferred, despite moderate evidence suggesting superior efﬁcacy of subcutaneous injections, due to the ease of oral administration and similar bioavailability at typical starting doses (23).

Initiation/titration of methotrexate to a weekly dose of at least 15 mg within 4 to 6 weeks is conditionally recommended over initiation/titration to a weekly dose of <15 mg. The recommendation is conditional because there are few studies comparing different dosing strategies and wide variation in.

# Table 3. Methotrexate administration*

|Recommendations|Certainty of evidence|Evidence report(s) of the following PICO(s)|Supp. App. 2|

† This recommendation refers only to the initial prescribing of methotrexate and is not meant to limit further dose escalation, which often provides additional efficacy.

‡ The first certainty of evidence applies to the first listed option; the second certainty of evidence applies to the second option.
---
# Recommendations for treatment modification in patients treated with DMARDs who are not at target (Table 4)

A treat-to-target approach is strongly recommended over usual care for patients who have not been previously treated with bDMARDs or tsDMARDs. This recommendation applies to dose optimization of methotrexate and to the subsequent addition of DMARDs when required. The recommendation is strong despite low-certainty evidence because of the recognized importance of systematic monitoring and adjustment of treatment to minimize inflammation to prevent joint damage, as well as other long-term sequelae including cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.

A minimal initial treatment goal of low disease activity is conditionally recommended over a goal of remission. An initial target of low disease activity is preferred because remission by established criteria may not be achievable for many patients (25). In addition, the patient panel emphasized that failure to reach a specified target may be disheartening and stressful for some patients. They emphasized that it would be preferable to initially aim for low disease activity and subsequently consider a goal of remission. However, treatment goals should be systematically reassessed over time and individualized to each patient to ensure that remission is targeted when possible. The recommendation is conditional because remission is a reasonable initial goal for patients with early disease and minimal exposure to bDMARDs and tsDMARDs, and patient preferences play a significant role in this decision.

# Modification of DMARD(s)

Addition of a bDMARD or tsDMARD is conditionally recommended over triple therapy (i.e., addition of sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine) for patients taking maximally tolerated doses of methotrexate who are not at target. The panel vigorously debated whether to recommend addition of a bDMARD or tsDMARD versus sulfasalazine and other treatments.

# ACR GUIDELINE FOR TREATMENT OF RA

Use of glucocorticoids

Addition of/switching to DMARDs is conditionally recommended over continuation of glucocorticoids for patients taking glucocorticoids to remain at target. This recommendation assumes that improved disease control with DMARDs should allow less use of glucocorticoids. The recommendation is conditional because the continued use of glucocorticoids may be required for patients who do not respond to DMARDs even after maximizing methotrexate dosage and switching DMARD classes.

Addition of/switching to DMARDs (with or without intraarticular [IA] glucocorticoids) is conditionally recommended over the use of IA glucocorticoids alone for patients taking DMARDs who are not at target. This recommendation was based on the premise that DMARDs should be adjusted to reduce disease activity, irrespective of treatment with IA glucocorticoids. The recommendation is conditional because patients may choose to defer adding/switching DMARDs if they obtain relief from IA injection(s).

Switching to a bDMARD or tsDMARD of a different class is conditionally recommended over switching to a bDMARD or tsDMARD belonging to the same class for patients taking a bDMARD or tsDMARD who are not at target. The recommendation is based on very low-certainty evidence supporting greater improvement in disease activity and drug survival among patients switching classes. The recommendation is conditional because patient and physician preferences are likely to vary based on prior experiences with specific DMARDs.

# Recommendations for tapering/discontinuing DMARDs (Table 5)

Because of the moderate- to-high risk for flare and the potential for irreversible long-term damage associated with stopping all DMARDs, the following recommendations presume that patients maintain a therapeutic dose of at least 1 DMARD. In addition, the recommendations specify that patients be at target (low disease activity or remission) for at least 6 months.

|Recommendations|Certainty of evidence|Evidence report(s) of the following PICO(s)|Supp. App. 2|
|---|---|---|---|
|Continuation of all DMARDs at their current dose is conditionally recommended over a dose reduction of a DMARD.|Low|PICO 54.a|p. 381|

Prior to tapering. Patients in remission for &lt;6 months should not routinely be considered for dose reduction or withdrawal. Although the optimal time at target prior to tapering has not been established, the voting panel considered 6 months to be a reasonable minimal length of time to ensure stable disease control. “Dose reduction” refers to lowering the dose or increasing the dosing interval of a DMARD. “Gradual discontinuation” denotes gradually lowering the dose of a DMARD and subsequently stopping it.

# Recommendations for specific patient populations

|Table 6|Table 6|
|---|
|Subcutaneous nodules|Recommendation|
|Methotrexate|Conditionally recommended over alternative DMARDs for patients with subcutaneous nodules who have moderate-to-high disease activity|
|Switching to a non-methotrexate DMARD|Conditionally recommended over continuation of methotrexate for patients taking methotrexate with progressive subcutaneous nodules|

These recommendations are based on studies demonstrating a higher risk of flare in patients who are 1) lowering the dose of a DMARD versus continuing DMARDs at the same dose, and 2) abruptly versus gradually discontinuing a DMARD. The recommendations are conditional because patient and physician preferences are expected to vary. The recommendation to switch is based on the premise that methotrexate is a contributing factor to progressive nodulosis.

# Pulmonary disease

Methotrexate is conditionally recommended over alternative DMARDs for the treatment of inflammatory arthritis for patients with clinically diagnosed mild and stable airway or parenchymal lung disease, or incidental disease detected on imaging, who have moderate-to-high disease activity.

Studies indicate that preexisting lung disease is a risk factor for methotrexate-related pneumonitis. However, the overall risk of worsening lung disease attributable to methotrexate is uncertain, and alternative DMARDs have also been associated with lung disease. The recommendation is in favor of methotrexate because of its important role as an anchor treatment in RA and the lack of alternatives with similar efficacy and/or superior long-term safety profiles. The recommendation is conditional because some clinicians (rheumatologists and pulmonologists) and patients will prefer an alternative option rather than accept any additional risk of lung toxicity. Patients with preexisting lung disease should be informed of their increased risk of methotrexate pneumonitis prior to initiating treatment with methotrexate.

# Table 7. Key clinical questions requiring further research*

because of the very low-certainty evidence supporting these PICO questions.

# Methotrexate administration

- At what dose and route of administration should methotrexate be started?
- Does switching to non-methotrexate DMARDs improve tolerability over increasing the dose of folic acid, or using folinic acid or using split dose or subcutaneous dosing, for RA patients with side effects when taking methotrexate?
- What is the efficacy of TTT in different patient populations (early versus late, bDMARD-or tsDMARD-exposed, elderly-onset, comorbidities)?
- What is the optimal target and method of assessment of disease activity for TTT in different populations?

# Comparative effectiveness/safety

- What is the comparative effectiveness/safety between bDMARDs and tsDMARDs?
- What is the comparative effectiveness/safety between adding bDMARDs or tsDMARDs to methotrexate and switching to bDMARD or tsDMARD monotherapy?
- What is the comparative effectiveness/safety between TTT by maximizing use of methotrexate (i.e., escalating dose via subcutaneous route) and adding/switching to bDMARD or tsDMARD monotherapy?
- When, which, and how should DMARDs be tapered/discontinued?
- Do clinical or biologic markers predict a differential response to DMARDs?

# Comorbidities

- What is the effectiveness/safety of alternative treatment strategies in RA patients with clinical lung disease or NAFLD?
- Which DMARDs can be initiated or continued after receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy?
- Which DMARDs should be used in patients with solid malignancies, including skin cancer?
- Is there a time frame before which DMARDs can be started/resumed in patients with concomitant solid malignancies?

* DMARDs = biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs; RA = rheumatoid arthritis; TTT = treat-to-target; bDMARD = biologic DMARD; tsDMARD = targeted synthetic DMARD; NAFLD = nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.

# Heart failure

- Addition of a non–TNF inhibitor bDMARD or tsDMARD is conditionally recommended over addition of a TNF inhibitor for patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure and an inadequate response to csDMARDs.
- Switching to a non–TNF inhibitor bDMARD or tsDMARD is conditionally recommended over continuation of a TNF inhibitor for patients taking a TNF inhibitor who develop heart failure.

These recommendations were made based on the risk of hepatitis B reactivation due to core antibody and surface antigen status and the specific DMARD being initiated and are consistent with the updated American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases guidance (48). Patients at risk for hepatitis B reactivation should be comanaged with a hepatologist. The third recommendation is conditional because it is less certain whether the benefit of prophylactic antiviral therapy outweighs the risks and cost of this treatment in the specified patient population.
---
# ACR GUIDELINE FOR TREATMENT OF RA

Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with combination csDMARDs (dual or triple therapy) compared to bDMARDs or tsDMARDs (50). Some clinicians may prefer csDMARDs even if the serious infection occurred >12 months prior to considering a change.

# Methotrexate

Methotrexate is conditionally recommended over alternative DMARDs for DMARD-naive patients with NAFLD, normal liver enzymes and liver function tests, and no evidence of advanced liver fibrosis who have moderate-to-high disease activity.

Given the concerns about the risk of hepatotoxicity associated with methotrexate therapy in patients with NAFLD, use of methotrexate should be restricted to patients with normal liver enzymes and liver function tests and without evidence of liver disease or liver fibrosis (Stage 3 or 4). Noninvasive testing to diagnose and stage liver fibrosis as well as consultation with a gastroenterologist or hepatologist should be considered in patients prior to initiating methotrexate (49). In addition, more frequent monitoring should be performed in this patient population (every 4 to 8 weeks). The recommendation is conditional because patients’ and clinicians’ risk tolerance varies.

# Nontuberculous mycobacterial (NTM) lung disease

Given the variability of NTM lung disease severity and response to treatment, patients should be closely comanaged with an infectious disease or pulmonary specialist.

Use of the lowest possible dose of glucocorticoids (discontinuation if possible) is conditionally recommended over continuation of glucocorticoids without dose modification for patients with NTM lung disease. This recommendation is based on studies suggesting an increased risk of NTM lung disease in patients receiving either inhaled or oral glucocorticoids (54,55).

Continuation of rituximab therapy for patients at target is conditionally recommended over switching to a different bDMARD or tsDMARD. Continuing rituximab in patients who are at target is preferred because of the uncertain clinical significance of hypogammaglobulinemia in patients without infection. Although an increased risk of infection has been described in RA patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, it is not known if a switch in DMARDs in patients who are at target is more effective in lowering infection risk while maintaining disease control than continuation of rituximab. The recommendation is conditional because physician and patient risk tolerance is likely to vary depending on the degree of hypogammaglobulinemia and patient-specific risk factors for infection.

Addition of csDMARDs is conditionally recommended over addition of a bDMARD or tsDMARD for patients with NTM lung disease who have moderate-to-high disease activity despite csDMARD monotherapy. This recommendation is based on the lower expected risk of NTM lung disease associated with csDMARDs compared to bDMARDs and tsDMARDs (56).

Abatacept is conditionally recommended over other bDMARDs and tsDMARDs for patients with NTM lung disease who have moderate-to-high disease activity despite csDMARDs. Abatacept is conditionally recommended over other bDMARDs and tsDMARDs based on population data extrapolated from studies on tuberculosis (57). There is considerable uncertainty regarding the risk of mycobacterial infections associated with non-TNF inhibitor bDMARDs and tsDMARDs; however, TNF inhibitors are associated with increased rates of mycobacterial infections and should be avoided (58).

# FRAENKEL ET AL

# network meta-analyses

The preceding 3 recommendations are conditional because of the very low-certainty evidence supporting the analysis of the differences in treatment outcomes posed by these PICO questions. The recommendation statements in this update are not directly comparable to the ACR 2015 guidelines (1) because they do not retain the early versus established RA subgroups. Nevertheless, there are some notable differences. First, the 2015 guidelines recommend csDMARD monotherapy, preferably with methotrexate, for patients with both low and moderate/high disease activity, whereas this update recommends an initial trial of hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine for those with low disease activity. Second, the 2015 guidelines recommended DMARD tapering for patients who are in remission. In this update, tapering recommendations are made for patients who are in low disease activity or remission in the face of a paucity of data about when and how best to taper. The panel recommended that careful tapering might be considered if the patient wishes to cut back on their use of DMARDs. However, patients should be closely evaluated during any taper, and if a flare occurs, the prior regimen should be reinstituted promptly. Last, this update includes several recommendations against the use of glucocorticoid therapy. These recommendations were made in recognition of the frequent difficulty tapering glucocorticoids leading to undesirable prolonged use and the increasing evidence of the negative impact of glucocorticoids on long-term patient outcomes, including risk for infection, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease, in RA and other rheumatic diseases (62–65).

# DISCUSSION

On February 4, 2021, the FDA released a Drug Safety Alert noting a possible increased risk of major cardiovascular events and malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) in patients with RA (over the age of 50 years with at least 1 risk factor for cardiovascular disease) participating in a randomized controlled trial designed to compare the safety of tofacitinib to adalimumab (18). Recommendations will be reviewed once peer-reviewed results are published. Rapidly evolving comparative effectiveness and safety signals associated with JAK inhibitors highlight the need to engage in a shared decision-making process when adjusting DMARDs (16,59). In addition, although previous recommendations cautioned against the use of TNF inhibitors in patients with skin cancer (1), the results of more recently published studies examining specific DMARD-related risks of non-melanoma skin cancer and melanoma do not support making a definite recommendation for or against specific DMARDs (60,61).

The panel also considered PICO questions related to current use of checkpoint inhibitor therapy, but the variability in current practice patterns and differences in treatment for specific cancer types precluded the development of specific recommendations for patients who are candidates for, or are currently receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy. We anticipate that additional recommendations for patients with systemic rheumatic diseases and solid malignancies will be developed as further data become available. There were vigorous discussions pertaining to recommendations for specific DMARDs in patients with moderate-to-high disease activity despite csDMARDs and with a history of serious infection. However, the evidence was insufficient to support a recommendation. Future studies (using large registries and stated in the 2015 guidelines (66). Patients also strongly preferred initial treatment with combination csDMARDs over methotrexate monotherapy because they placed greater value on the incremental benefits associated with combination therapy compared to clinicians.

# ACR GUIDELINE FOR TREATMENT OF RA

discontinuing over a dose reduction of a DMARD whenever possible, whereas most clinicians on the voting panel preferred dose reduction. This discordance reflects patient preference to minimize use of medications once they reach target versus physician preference to minimize flare. However, both the patient and voting panel stressed the variability in patient preferences for tapering. These differences reinforce the importance of using a shared decision-making approach in RA.

When clinically relevant, recommendations specify the level of disease activity in the patient population (Table 1). However, evidence tables include pooled data from studies that often use different measures of disease activity; thus, specific definitions of low versus moderate- to-high disease activity are not provided for specific recommendations. Despite the large body of literature related to pharmacologic treatments for RA, the review team did not identify high-certainty evidence for many of the questions addressed. This discrepancy is due to the differences between clinically important PICO questions and the specific objectives of clinical trials. For example, few studies have examined how to best dose and administer methotrexate, the most effective and safe use of DMARDs in high-risk populations, and the risk–benefit tradeoffs associated with glucocorticoid use. Moreover, many trials could not be matched to specific PICO questions because of differences between the trials and the PICO questions’ specified study populations and treatment comparisons. Thus, many recommendations are based largely on very low-certainty or low-certainty evidence. Incorporating medical evidence and expert input and consensus into clinical guidelines is core to the GRADE process and strengthens recommendations, particularly when there is limited evidence. Important gaps in knowledge are described in Table 7.

In summary, this update includes recommendations related to initiation and adjustment of DMARD therapy in patients with RA. It also emphasizes the importance of minimizing use of glucocorticoids. It is expected that additional data may modify the direction and/or strength of specific recommendations. The ACR will update the recommendations and answer these and other questions as new data are published.
