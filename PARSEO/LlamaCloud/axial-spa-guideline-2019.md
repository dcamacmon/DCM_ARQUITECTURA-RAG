Guidelines and recommendations developed and/or endorsed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) are intended to provide guidance for particular patterns of practice and not to dictate the care of a particular patient. The ACR considers adherence to the recommendations within this guideline to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the health care provider in light of each patient’s individual circumstances. Guidelines and recommendations are intended to promote beneficial or desirable outcomes but cannot guarantee any specific outcome. Guidelines and recommendations developed and endorsed by the ACR are subject to periodic revision as warranted by the evolution of medical knowledge, technology, and practice. ACR recommendations are not intended to dictate payment or insurance decisions. These recommendations cannot adequately convey all uncertainties and nuances of patient care.

# Objective

To update evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis (SpA).

# Methods

We conducted updated systematic literature reviews for 20 clinical questions on pharmacologic treatment addressed in the 2015 guidelines, and for 26 new questions on pharmacologic treatment, treat-to-target strategy, and use of imaging. New questions addressed the use of secukinumab, ixekizumab, tofacitinib, tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) biosimilars, and biologic tapering/discontinuation, among others. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation methodology to assess the quality of evidence and formulate recommendations and required at least 70% agreement among the voting panel.

# Results

Recommendations for AS and nonradiographic axial SpA are similar. TNFi are recommended over secukinumab or ixekizumab as the first biologic to be used. Secukinumab or ixekizumab is recommended over the use of a second TNFi in patients with primary nonresponse to the first TNFi. TNFi, secukinumab, and ixekizumab are favored over tofacitinib. Co-administration of low-dose methotrexate with TNFi is not recommended, nor is a strict treat-to-target strategy or discontinuation or tapering of biologics in patients with stable disease. Sulfasalazine is recommended only for persistent peripheral arthritis when TNFi are contraindicated. For patients with unclear disease activity, spine or pelvis magnetic resonance imaging could aid assessment. Routine monitoring of radiographic changes with serial spine radiographs is not recommended.

# Conclusion

These recommendations provide updated guidance regarding use of new medications and imaging of the axial skeleton in the management of AS and nonradiographic axial SpA.

# INTRODUCTION

The advent of new medications to treat axial SpA warranted this update. We did not reexamine all of the 2015 recommendations, but rather focused on those questions for which consequential new evidence was present. We added several new recommendations on how the newly available medications should fit in treatment strategies and on the use of imaging. The target populations are adults with AS or nonradiographic axial SpA. The target users of these recommendations are rheumatologists, primary care clinicians, physiatrists, physical therapists, and others providing care to patients with axial SpA.

Axial spondyloarthritis (SpA), comprising ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and nonradiographic axial SpA, is the main form of chronic inflammatory arthritis affecting the axial skeleton (1). AS affects 0.1–0.5% of the population, and is characterized by inflammatory back pain, radiographic sacroiliitis, excess spinal bone formation, and a high prevalence of HLA–B27 (2,3). Although nonradiographic axial SpA shares several features with AS, advanced sacroiliac joint damage and spine ankylosis are absent (4). The severity of arthralgia, stiffness, and limited flexibility varies widely among patients and over the course of axial SpA. Skeletal disease may be accompanied by uveitis, psoriasis, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Axial SpA can impose substantial physical and social burdens on patients, and can interfere with work and schooling (5,6). The goals of treatment are to alleviate symptoms, improve functioning, maintain the ability to work, decrease disease complications, and forestall skeletal damage as much as possible.

# METHODS

These recommendations followed ACR and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology (8,9), as described in Supplementary Appendix 1, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract. Briefly, systematic literature reviews were done for prespecified clinical population, intervention, comparator, outcomes (PICO) questions. The resulting evidence was reviewed, and recommendations formulated and voted on, by an expert voting panel (see Supplementary Appendices 2–5 at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract). Key definitions, including ones for active and stable disease, are provided in Table 1. Clinical trials of ixekizumab became available during the time the manuscript was in preparation, after the voting panel had met (10,11). The data from these trials were provided to the voting panel, and revised recommendations that included ixekizumab were reviewed and voted on by the panel.

# ACR/SAA/SPARTAN 2019 TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS IN AS

# Table 1. Definitions of key terms*

|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|Active disease|Disease causing symptoms at an unacceptably bothersome level to the patient and judged by the examining clinician to be due to inflammation.|
|Stable disease|Disease that was asymptomatic or causing symptoms but at an acceptable level as reported by the patient. A minimum of 6 months was required to qualify as clinically stable.|
|Primary nonresponse|Absence of a clinically meaningful improvement in disease activity over the 3 to 6 months after treatment initiation, not related to toxicity or poor adherence.|
|Secondary nonresponse|Recurrence of ankylosing spondylitis activity, not due to treatment interruption or poor adherence, after having a sustained clinically meaningful improvement on treatment (generally, beyond the initial 6 months of treatment).|
|Conventional synthetic antirheumatic drug|Sulfasalazine, methotrexate, leflunomide, apremilast, thalidomide, pamidronate.|
|Biosimilar|Biopharmaceuticals that are copies of an original biologic medication and tested to be of the same purity and potency as the original. In these recommendations, we refer only to TNFi biosimilars. Examples include infliximab-dyyb, etanercept-szzs, and adalimumab-atto.|
|TNFi|Infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab, and their biosimilars.|
|TNFi monoclonal antibodies|Infliximab, adalimumab, certolizumab, golimumab.|
|Biologics|TNFi, abatacept, rituximab, sarilumab, tocilizumab, ustekinumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab.**|
|High-quality evidence|Studies that provide high confidence in the effect estimate, and new data from future studies are thought unlikely to change the effect.|
|Moderate-quality evidence|Studies that provide confidence that the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate but could be substantially different.|
|Low-quality evidence|Studies that provide limited confidence about the effect, and the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate.|
|Very low-quality evidence|Studies that provide very little certainty about the effect, and the true effect may be quite different from the estimate.|
|Strong recommendation|Action should be favored in almost all patients, usually requiring high-quality evidence, high confidence that future research will not alter the conclusion, AND an assessment that the desirable effects of the intervention outweigh the undesirable effects. Should not be taken to imply that the intervention has large clinical benefits.|
|Conditional recommendation|Action should be followed in only selected cases, often limited by low-quality evidence, OR when the desirable and undesirable consequences of an intervention are more balanced, OR if patients’ preferences for the intervention are thought to vary widely.|
|Patient preferences|Beliefs and expectations regarding potential benefits and harms of treatment and how these relate to an individual’s goals for health and life.|
|Shared decision-making|The process by which a patient and clinician arrive at an individualized treatment decision based on an understanding of the potential benefits and risks of available treatment options and of a patient’s values and preferences.|

* TNFi = tumor necrosis factor inhibitor.

# RESULTS

# A. Recommendations for the treatment of patients with active AS

Here we present the recommendations that were reviewed in this update, whether it was a new recommendation (designated “new”) or reevaluation of an existing recommendation. Table 2 and Table 3 provide all current recommendations, including those from the 2015 report that were not newly reviewed. The order of recommendations presented here does not imply priority for use or recommended sequencing of different interventions. PICO numbers following each recommendation can be used to locate related evidence in Supplementary Appendix 6, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract.

The efficacy of NSAIDs for symptom improvement in active AS has been established in many controlled trials. Evidence that continuous NSAID use results in slower rates of spinal fusion on radiographs over 2 years compared to on-demand NSAID use is inconsistent, with results of one trial of celecoxib suggesting less progression with continuous use, and one trial of diclofenac indicating no difference in progression (12,13) (See Supplementary Appendix 6, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract).

**Correction added on 26 September 2019, after first online publication: Secukinumab and ixekizumab were omitted in Table 1. They have been restored in this version of the article.

† These recommendations were from 2015 and were not reviewed in this update. The number preceding the recommendation is the recommendation number and is referenced as bracketed numbers in Figure 1.

Uncertainty regarding potential disease-modifying effects, the committee conditionally favored continuous use of NSAIDs in patients with active AS, primarily for controlling disease activity. The decision to use NSAIDs continuously may vary depending on the severity of symptoms, patient preferences, and comorbidities, particularly gastrointestinal and kidney comorbidities, and cardiovascular disease.

In adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs, we conditionally recommend treatment with sulfasalazine, methotrexate, or tofacitinib over no treatment with these medications (new, PICO 7). Sulfasalazine or methotrexate should be considered only in patients with prominent peripheral arthritis or when tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are not available.

Treatment with sulfasalazine is recommended primarily for patients with prominent peripheral arthritis and few or no axial symptoms. However, TNFi may provide a better option for these patients. Evidence for the efficacy of sulfasalazine is based on 8 older controlled trials that showed benefit for peripheral arthritis (see Supplementary Appendix 6, on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract).

In adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs, we do not recommend any particular TNFi as the preferred choice (PICO 5). The efficacy of TNFi in patients with active AS has been demonstrated in 24 randomized controlled trials, most of which were short-term (6 months or shorter) placebo-controlled studies. Improvements were shown in patient-reported outcomes, composite response criteria, and spine and sacroiliac inflammation on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (see Supplementary Appendix 6, on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract).
---
tion for use of TNFi in patients whose AS remained active (as defined in Table 1) despite treatment with NSAIDs. The panel recommended that lack of response (or intolerance) to at least 2 different NSAIDs at maximal doses over 1 month, or incomplete responses to at least 2 different NSAIDs over 2 months, would be adequate trials with which to judge NSAID responsiveness prior to escalating to treatment with TNFi.

Indirect comparisons in network meta-analyses of clinical trials have not showed clinically meaningful differences in short-term efficacy among TNFi in the treatment of active AS (see Supplementary Appendix 6, at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract) (21). Direct comparisons among these medications are limited to a trial of infliximab versus its biosimilar, and a very small open-label trial of infliximab versus etanercept (22,23). The panel judged that the evidence did not support preference of 1 TNFi over any other for the typical patient. Important exceptions apply to patients with recurrent uveitis or coexistent IBD (see PICO 29 and PICO 32 below). Patients treated with infliximab may have increased risks of tuberculosis and of infections generally (24,25). TNFi other than infliximab should be considered for patients at higher risk of tuberculosis exposure (either through travel or household contacts) or with a history of recurrent infections. Patient preferences regarding the frequency of dosing and route of administration should be weighed when selecting a specific TNFi.

In adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs, we conditionally recommend treatment with TNFi over treatment with tofacitinib (new, PICO 60).

In adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs, we conditionally recommend treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab over treatment with tofacitinib (new, PICO 61).

The use of secukinumab and ixekizumab in patients with active AS is supported by data from large placebo-controlled trials (see Supplementary Appendix 6, on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract). The panel recommended use of TNFi over secukinumab or ixekizumab based on greater experience with TNFi and familiarity with their long-term safety and toxicity. Similarly, the panel judged that TNFi, secukinumab, or ixekizumab should be used over tofacitinib, given the larger evidence base for TNFi, secukinumab, and ixekizumab. In patients with coexisting ulcerative colitis, if treatment with TNFi is not an option, tofacitinib should be considered over secukinumab or ixekizumab. Interleukin-17 (IL-17) inhibitors have not been shown to be efficacious in IBD, although tofacitinib is an approved treatment for ulcerative colitis (26,27).

In adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs and who have contraindications to TNFi, we conditionally recommend treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab over treatment with sulfasalazine, methotrexate, or tofacitinib (new, PICO 8).

No studies have directly compared the risks and benefits of treatment alternatives in patients who have contraindications to treatment with TNFi. The panel favored treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab over treatment with sulfasalazine or methotrexate based on a higher likelihood of benefit, but this recommendation was conditional on the specific contraindication. If the contraindication to TNFi use was the presence of congestive heart failure or demyelinating disease, secukinumab or ixekizumab was preferred, since these medications have not been shown to worsen these conditions. If the contraindication to TNFi use was tuberculosis, other chronic infection, or a high risk of recurrent infections, sulfasalazine was preferred over secukinumab, ixekizumab, and tofacitinib. In these cases, efforts to mitigate the infections should be undertaken so that TNFi might safely be used. Treatment with rituximab, abatacept, ustekinumab, or IL-6 inhibitors is not recommended, even in patients with contraindications to TNFi, due to lack of effectiveness.

In adults with active AS despite treatment with the first TNFi used, we conditionally recommend treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab over treatment with a different TNFi in patients with primary nonresponse to TNFi (new, PICO 10).

In adults with active AS despite treatment with the first TNFi used, we conditionally recommend treatment with a different TNFi over treatment with a non-TNFi biologic in patients with secondary nonresponse to TNFi (new, PICO 10).

In adults with active AS despite treatment with the first TNFi used, we strongly recommend against switching to treatment with a biosimilar of the first TNFi (new, PICO 62).

In adults with active AS despite treatment with the first TNFi used, we conditionally recommend against the addition of sulfasalazine or methotrexate in favor of switching to a new biologic (PICO 9).

Direct comparisons of treatment strategies for patients who do not have or sustain adequate responses to their first TNFi have not been reported, and the recommendations are based on the panel’s consideration of indirect comparisons among the available treatment options (see Supplementary Appendix 6, at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract). Data from observational studies suggest that 25–40% of patients who switch from one TNFi to another will have a meaningful response (e.g.,

50% improvement in Bath AS Disease Activity Index) to the second TNFi (28–30). However, not all patients in these studies switched TNFi because of ineffectiveness.

# B. Recommendations for the treatment of patients with stable AS

In adults with stable AS, we conditionally recommend on-demand treatment with NSAIDs over continuous treatment with NSAIDs (PICO 1).

This recommendation applies to patients whose AS has been stable while not receiving any pharmacologic treatment. In this group, the panel considered that the potential toxicities of continuous NSAID treatment outweighed the uncertain benefit of less radiographic progression. On-demand treatment should be considered for short-term symptom recurrences (flares).

In adults with stable AS receiving treatment with TNFi and NSAIDs, we conditionally recommend continuing treatment with TNFi alone over continuing both medications (PICO 11).

In adults with stable AS receiving treatment with TNFi and a conventional synthetic antirheumatic drug, we conditionally recommend continuing treatment with TNFi alone over continuing both medications (PICO 12).

No new studies have directly compared outcomes between patients who continued combination treatment and those who discontinued either NSAIDs or a conventional synthetic antirheumatic drug (csARD). The NSAID-sparing potential of etanercept was demonstrated in a recent trial (33). The panel judged these recommendations primarily based on symptom control, rather than on any potential effect of combination therapy on future spinal fusion. In stable patients, a trial of withdrawing either the NSAIDs or the csARD should be considered, due to the likelihood of greater toxicity with the long-term use of more than one medication. However, on-demand NSAID treatment for control of intermittent symptoms is recommended for patients with good responses to previous courses of NSAIDs.

In adults with either active or stable AS on treatment with TNFi, we conditionally recommend against co-treatment with low-dose methotrexate (new, PICO 64).

In rheumatoid arthritis, the likelihood of TNFi discontinuation is lower among patients who receive co-treatment with methotrexate, perhaps by reducing the development of antidrug antibodies (31). In AS, it is less clear whether the duration of TNFi use, and by inference their effectiveness, is similarly prolonged (32). Data from observational studies are conflicting, although some studies, primarily of infliximab, showed longer TNFi treatment when methotrexate was co-administered (see Supplementary Appendix 6 at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract).

Clinical responses were not greater among patients who received co-treatment with methotrexate. In the absence of convincing evidence of benefit, and due to greater burden for patients, the panel recommended against routine co-administration of methotrexate with TNFi, although its use could be considered in patients treated with infliximab.

In general, treatment with a biologic should be planned to be...
---
continued long-term, barring toxicities. Discontinuation might be considered in patients in sustained remission (i.e., several years), with the anticipation that only one-third of patients would not experience relapse. Patient preferences should help guide this decision.

Tapering of TNFi could entail a change in either the dose or frequency of administration. Two controlled unblinded trials of tapering etanercept to 25 mg weekly versus maintaining the dose at 50 mg weekly in patients with stable AS showed that remission or partial remission was somewhat less likely among those in whom etanercept was tapered (34,35). In small observational studies, 53–70% of patients were still receiving their reduced dose at 2 years, but there is little evidence regarding maintenance of long-term remission after tapering of TNFi (see Supplementary Appendix 6, available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract). Therefore, the panel recommended against tapering of biologics as a standard approach. One condition in which tapering could be considered would be in patients with prolonged stable AS, if the patient and provider engage in shared decision-making.

In adults with stable AS receiving an originator TNFi, we strongly recommend continuing treatment with the originator TNFi over mandated switching to its biosimilar (new, PICO 63).

While the efficacy of originator and biosimilar TNFi is comparable, and although either could be chosen to initiate new courses of TNFi treatment, it was the opinion of the panel to recommend against mandated switching to a biosimilar during the course of treatment, in the absence of evidence of interchangeability. Medication changes can increase the risk of destabilizing a patient’s condition, and the panel judged that additional data were needed to understand the frequency of potential problems and concerns associated with switching patients who were stable on an originator TNFi to its biosimilar. Given these concerns, the panel judged that there should be a compelling rationale for switching medications, particularly in light of the marginal cost savings apparent for US patients (36).

# C. Recommendations for adults with AS-related comorbidities

In adults with AS and recurrent uveitis, we conditionally recommend treatment with TNFi monoclonal antibodies over treatment with other biologics (PICO 29).

Evidence for this recommendation is limited to indirect comparisons of the rates of acute uveitis episodes in clinical trials or observational studies, rather than from direct comparisons (see Supplementary Appendix 6, available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract). Many reports showed overall rates of uveitis without separately reporting recurrences as opposed to incident episodes (37). The rates were generally lower for adalimumab and infliximab compared to etanercept. For example, a large observational study demonstrated rates of uveitis (per 100 patient-years) in patients receiving adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept of 13.6, 27.5, and 60.3, respectively, compared to pretreatment rates of 36.8, 45.5, and 41.6, respectively (38). Adalimumab or infliximab are preferred over etanercept for the treatment of AS in patients with recurrent uveitis. Certolizumab or golimumab may also be considered, although supporting data are less substantial (39,40). Data from clinical trials suggest that rates of uveitis flares were not different between patients with AS treated with secukinumab and those treated with placebo, but more evidence is needed. Secukinumab was not efficacious in the treatment of panuveitis or posterior uveitis (41). Rates of uveitis flares among patients treated with ixekizumab have not been well-defined.

In adults with AS and IBD, we conditionally recommend treatment with TNFi monoclonal antibodies over treatment with other biologics (PICO 32).

This recommendation was based on limited indirect evidence on the risks of flares or new onset of IBD among patients with AS during treatment with biologics, and the much larger literature on the treatment of IBD in general. Patients with AS treated with infliximab or adalimumab have lower risks of IBD exacerbations than those treated with etanercept (see Supplementary Appendix 6, on the http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract). Infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab are approved for the treatment of Crohn’s disease, and infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab are approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, while etanercept is not approved for either condition (42,43). This evidence is the basis for the recommendation favoring TNFi monoclonal antibody use in patients with AS and coexisting IBD. The choice of the particular TNFi monoclonal antibody should be made in consultation with the patient’s gastroenterologist. Secukinumab has been associated with the new onset, or exacerbation, of Crohn’s disease (44–46). Increased risks of IBD exacerbation appear to also occur with ixekizumab (47).

# D. Recommendations for the treatment of patients with either active or stable nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis

Parallel questions on pharmacologic treatment were investigated for patients with nonradiographic axial SpA. There were no relevant published data for 19 questions. There was high-quality evidence only for the use of TNFi in nonradiographic axial SpA, which was examined in several clinical trials. Low-quality or very low-quality evidence from single studies suggested no differences in outcomes among different TNFi in nonradiographic axial SpA, high likelihood of relapse following discontinuation of TNFi, and no association between co-treatment with nonbiologics and TNFi persistence (see Supplementary Appendix 6, available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract).
---
# ACR/SAA/SPARTAN 2019 TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS IN AS

Therefore, the recommendations for nonradiographic axial SpA were largely extrapolated from evidence in AS (Table 3). The recommendations were identical in both patient groups with 1 notable exception: treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab was strongly recommended over no treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab in patients with AS, while use of these medications was conditionally recommended in patients with nonradiographic axial SpA, because trials in nonradiographic axial SpA have not been reported. Evidence on tofacitinib in nonradiographic axial SpA has not been reported.

# E. Disease activity assessment and imaging

In adults with active AS, we conditionally recommend against using the treat-to-target strategy, which aims at a target of an Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score <1.3 (or 2.1), over a treatment strategy based on physician assessment (new, PICO 67).

The concept of treat-to-target strategies is well-founded in chronic disease management for conditions that have an accurate measure of disease activity (often one that is asymptomatic, as in blood pressure or glycosylated hemoglobin), a tight link between this disease activity measure and future health outcomes, and evidence that maintaining a particular target in the disease activity measure is closely associated with better long-term health (48). The treat-to-target approach in AS is indirectly supported by associations between levels of AS activity and future radiographic progression but lacks robust direct evidence. Because adoption of this strategy would place additional burdens on patients and providers, the panel judged that more convincing evidence of benefit should be present before endorsing this change in practice. There was also concern that focus on a specific target could lead to rapid cycling through all currently available treatments in some patients. As reflected in the 2015 guidelines, quantifying disease activity is important to help guide treatment decisions.

In adults with AS of unclear activity while receiving a biologic, we conditionally recommend obtaining a spinal or pelvis MRI to assess activity (new, PICO 68).

In adults with nonradiographic axial SpA of unclear activity while receiving a biologic, we conditionally recommend obtaining a pelvis MRI to assess activity (new, PICO 81).

Because physical and laboratory measures are often normal despite active axial SpA, and because symptoms may be nonspecific, it may be difficult to know whether a patient is experiencing inflammation that warrants a change in treatment. Limited evidence suggests that knowledge of MRI findings in the spine and sacroiliac joints may alter treatment recommendations. However, the degree of inflammatory change on MRI may not correlate with treatment responses, and the location of inflammation may not correlate with the location of pain (49).

MRI is not recommended in patients in whom disease activity is either clearly clinically active or clinically stable, or when the results of MRI would not be expected to change treatment.

In adults with stable AS, we conditionally recommend against obtaining a spinal or pelvis MRI to confirm inactivity (new, PICO 69).

In adults with stable nonradiographic axial SpA, we conditionally recommend against obtaining a spine or pelvis MRI to confirm inactivity (new, PICO 82).

Given the lack of evidence that obtaining an MRI in stable patients improves clinical outcomes, the only moderate sensitivity and specificity of MRI-defined abnormalities for measurement of activity in axial SpA, the burden of testing, and concern for possible overtreatment, the panel recommended against obtaining an MRI in this setting. MRI could be considered in circumstances where the clinician and patient differ in their assessment of whether the disease is stable.

In adults with active or stable AS receiving any treatment, we conditionally recommend against obtaining repeat spine radiographs at a scheduled interval (e.g., every 2 years) as a standard approach (new, PICO 70).

In adults with active or stable nonradiographic axial SpA on any treatment, we conditionally recommend against obtaining repeat spine radiographs at a scheduled interval (e.g., every 2 years) as a standard approach (new, PICO 83).

Spine radiographs are useful for the diagnosis of axial SpA, in evaluating the extent of spinal fusion, and for investigating new spinal pain in patients with established AS. In research studies, small changes in the extent of spine damage can be detected in 20–35% of patients with AS over a 2-year interval (see Supplementary Appendix 6, available at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract).

# ACR/SAA/SPARTAN 2019 TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS IN AS

spine radiographs at a regular interval leads to better patient out-comes, and data balancing a clinical benefit with the risk of radiation exposure are absent. Therefore, the panel recommended against repeating spine radiographs as a standard approach. In the absence of clinical indications, repeat spine radiographs could be considered on an ad hoc basis for counseling patients on the progression of their disease, which may help in career and life planning.

# F. Summary of recommendations

Figure 1 presents a diagram of the main treatment recommendations for active and stable AS, integrating the new recommendations with the 2015 recommendations that were not updated in this review.

This update was primarily motivated by the availability of new treatment options, notably secukinumab, ixekizumab, tofacitinib, and TNFi biosimilars, for patients with axial SpA. Providers and patients have questions on where these new medications fit in the pharmacologic strategy, and how originator TNFi, sulfasalazine, and NSAIDs should be used given these new options. Based on the current evidence and the considerations of the panel, NSAIDs and TNFi remain the primary classes of medications for the treatment of AS and nonradiographic axial SpA. Secukinumab or ixekizumab is recommended for patients with active disease who have heart failure or demyelinating disease as a contraindication to TNFi, and in primary nonresponders to TNFi. Secukinumab and ixekizumab are not recommended in patients with IBD or recurrent uveitis, as TNFi monoclonal antibodies are better options. Tofacitinib is a potential second-line option for patients with contraindications to TNFi other than infections. Recommendations regarding tofacitinib may change pending the results of larger clinical trials.

Several of the 2015 recommendations were modified in this update. The current recommendation is conditionally in favor of use of sulfasalazine in limited clinical circumstances, whereas the 2015 recommendations had this as an exception to the general recommendation against the use of conventional synthetic anti-rheumatic drugs. In the 2015 recommendations, sulfasalazine and pamidronate were suggested as alternatives for the treatment of patients with active disease and contraindications to TNFi, while the current recommendations suggest use of secukinumab or ixekizumab in most of these cases (except patients with high risk of infections). In cases of failure of TNFi, the 2015 guidelines included a conditional recommendation for a trial of a second TNFi and against use of a non-TNFi biologic, whereas the current guidelines differentiate treatment recommendations based on whether there was primary or secondary nonresponse to the TNFi.

For the treatment of patients with recurrent uveitis, the previous guidelines specified conditional use of infliximab or adalimumab, while the update broadened this recommendation. Imaging remains a central tool in the diagnosis of axial SpA, but its role in monitoring patients is less well-defined. Spine and/or pelvis MRI could aid in the evaluation of patients in whom the degree of active inflammation is uncertain, and especially in those for whom the findings would change management. MRI is not recommended to seek subclinical inflammation in patients with stable disease (as defined in Table 1). However, MRI could be considered in circumstances where it may inform shared decision-making. We recommend against obtaining spine radiographs on scheduled intervals to monitor progression. This practice entails radiation exposure and would not alter treatment in most cases.

We used the GRADE method to develop these treatment recommendations in a way that was transparent, systematic, and explicit, and that was informed by the medical evidence as well as patient preferences. The major limitation of these guidelines is the very low quality of evidence for many recommendations, which necessitated reliance on the clinical expertise of the panel. For nonradiographic axial SpA, most recommendations were based on extrapolation of results from studies in AS. We tried to identify the most common and consequential treatment questions, so that the recommendations would be useful in guiding clinical decision-making. The low quality of evidence for many questions is an indication that research has not yet tackled many of the most important treatment questions. As more treatment options become available, this problem will grow. Importantly, failure to recommend a particular medication does not imply that it is contraindicated. Key evidence gaps include the comparative effectiveness and safety of different biologics, the optimal sequencing of treatments, and the role of NSAIDs.

This update addressed only a subset of treatment questions. The 2015 recommendations that were not reexamined are to be considered extant. Recommendations are meant to describe the approach to treatment of the typical patient and cannot anticipate all possible clinical scenarios. Application of these recommendations must be individualized, and requires.
