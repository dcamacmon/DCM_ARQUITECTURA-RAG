Guidelines and recommendations developed and/or endorsed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) are intended to provide guidance for particular patterns of practice and not to dictate the care of a particular patient. The ACR considers adherence to the recommendations within this guideline to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the health care provider in light of each patient’s individual circumstances. Guidelines and recommendations are intended to promote beneficial or desirable outcomes but cannot guarantee any specific outcome. Guidelines and recommendations developed and endorsed by the ACR are subject to periodic revision as warranted by the evolution of medical knowledge, technology, and practice. ACR recommendations are not intended to dictate payment or insurance decisions. These recommendations cannot adequately convey all uncertainties and nuances of patient care.

# Objective

To develop an evidence-based guideline for the pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of psoriatic arthritis (PsA), as a collaboration between the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF).

# Methods

We identified critical outcomes in PsA and clinically relevant PICO (population/intervention/comparator/outcomes) questions. A Literature Review Team performed a systematic literature review to summarize evidence supporting the benefits and harms of available pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies for PsA. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology was used to rate the quality of the evidence. A voting panel, including rheumatologists, dermatologists, other health professionals, and patients, achieved consensus on the direction and the strength of the recommendations.

# Results

The guideline covers the management of active PsA in patients who are treatment-naive and those who continue to have active PsA despite treatment, and addresses the use of oral small molecules, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, interleukin-12/23 inhibitors (IL-12/23i), IL-17 inhibitors, CTLA4-Ig (abatacept), and a JAK inhibitor (tofacitinib). We also developed recommendations for psoriatic spondylitis, predominant enthesitis, and treatment in the presence of concomitant inflammatory bowel disease, diabetes, or serious infections. We formulated recommendations for a treat-to-target strategy, vaccinations, and nonpharmacologic therapies. Six percent of the recommendations were strong and 94% conditional, indicating the importance of active discussion between the health care provider and the patient to choose the optimal treatment.

# Conclusion

The 2018 ACR/NPF PsA guideline serves as a tool for health care providers and patients in the selection of appropriate therapy in common clinical scenarios. Best treatment decisions consider each individual patient situation. The guideline is not meant to be proscriptive and should not be used to limit treatment options for patients with PsA.

# INTRODUCTION

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory musculoskeletal disease associated with psoriasis, manifesting most commonly with peripheral arthritis, dactylitis, enthesitis, and spondylitis. Nail lesions, including pitting and onycholysis, occur in ~80–90% of patients with PsA. The incidence of PsA is ~6 per 100,000 per year, and the prevalence is ~1–2 per 1,000 in the general population (1). The annual incidence of PsA in patients with psoriasis is 2.7% (2), and the reported prevalence of PsA among patients with psoriasis has varied between 6% and 41% (1). In the majority of patients the skin symptoms develop first, followed by the arthritis; however, in some patients the skin and joint symptoms present at the same time, and in 10–15% the arthritis presents first (2).

# ACR/NPF GUIDELINE FOR PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS TREATMENT

in disease remission (Figure 1). Clinicians and patients can now choose from a wide variety of pharmacologic therapies, including symptomatic treatments such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and intraarticular injections, as well as immunomodulatory therapies.

The presentation of PsA is heterogeneous, and health care providers frequently face challenges when considering the various treatment options. Our objective was to develop evidence-based treatment recommendations for the management of active PsA in adults, using pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies. These PsA treatment recommendations can help guide both clinicians and patients to arrive at optimal management decisions.

# METHODS

Methodology overview. This guideline followed the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline development process (http://www.rheumatology.org/Practice-Quality/Clinical-Support/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines). This process included using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology (13–15) (www.gradeworkinggroup.org) to rate the quality of the available evidence and to develop the recommendations. ACR policy guided disclosures and the management of conflicts of interest. The full methods are presented in detail in Supplementary Appendix 1, on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40726/abstract.

Additionally, a Patient Panel consisting of 9 adults with PsA reviewed the evidence and provided input on their values and preferences, which was reviewed before discussion of each section of PsA management (e.g., treatment-naive, treated, comorbidities), and was incorporated into discussions and formulation of recommendations. Supplementary Appendix 2 (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40726/abstract) presents rosters of the team and panel members. In accordance with ACR policy, the principal investigator and the leader of the literature review team were free of conflicts, and within each team, >50% of the members were free of conflicts.

|Non-pharmacologic therapies|Symptomatic treatments|OSM|TNFi|IL12/23i|IL1Zi|CTLA4-Ig|JAK inhibitor|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|physical therapy, occupational therapy, smoking cessation, weight loss, massage therapy; exercise|nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, local glucocorticoid injections|methotrexate, sulfasalazine, cyclosporine, leflunomide, apremilast|etanercept; infliximab, adalimumab, golimumab, certolizumab pegol|ustekinumab|secukinumab, ixekizumab, brodalumab|abatacept|tofacitinib|

Figure 1. Pharmacologic, nonpharmacologic, and symptomatic therapies for psoriatic arthritis. Pharmacologic therapies are displayed in the blue boxes and include oral small molecules (OSMs), tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) biologics, interleukin-17 inhibitor (IL-17i) biologics, an IL-12/23i biologic, CTLA4-immunoglobulin, and a JAK inhibitor. While there are numerous nonpharmacologic therapies available, 6 of these are addressed in this guideline. Symptomatic therapies include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, systemic glucocorticoids, and local glucocorticoid injections. Systemic glucocorticoids or local injections are not addressed in this guideline.

# Framework for the PsA guideline development

and scope of the guideline. Because there are numerous topics within PsA that could be addressed, at the beginning of the process the guideline panels made several decisions regarding the focus of this guideline and how to define aspects of the disease (e.g., active disease). At an initial scoping meeting, the Voting Panel and Expert Panel agreed that the project would include the management of patients with active PsA, defined as symptoms at an unacceptably bothersome level as reported by the patient and judged by the examining health care provider to be due to PsA based on the presence of at least 1 of the following: actively inflamed joints, dactylitis, enthesitis, axial disease, active skin and/or nail involvement, and/or extraarticular manifestations such as uveitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The health care provider may, in deciding if symptoms are due to active PsA, consider information beyond the core information from the history and physical examination, such as inflammation markers (C-reactive protein [CRP] or erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR]) and imaging results. At the scoping meeting, the panels decided that the guideline would address both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies for the treatment of PsA. We examined evidence regarding vaccinations, treatment in the presence of common comorbidities, and implementing a treat-to-target strategy.

# Systematic synthesis of the literature

Systematic searches of the published English-language literature included Ovid Medline, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library (including Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Health Technology Assessments) from the beginning of each database through November 15, 2016 (Supplementary Appendix 3, on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40726/abstract); we conducted updated searches on May 2, 2017 and again on March 8, 2018. DistillerSR software (https://distillercer.com/products/distillersr-systematic-reviewsoftware/) (Supplementary Appendix 4; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40726/abstract) was used to facilitate duplicate screening of literature search results. Reviewers entered extracted data into RevMan software (http://tech.cochrane.org/revman), and evaluated the risk of bias in primary studies using the Cochrane risk of bias tool (http://handbook.cochrane.org/). We exported RevMan files into GRADEpro software to formulate a GRADE summary of findings table (Supplementary Appendix 5; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40726/abstract) for each PICO question. Additionally, a network meta-analysis was performed when sufficient studies were available. GRADE criteria provided the framework for judging the overall quality of evidence.

# Critical outcomes

The panels chose the critical outcomes for all comparisons at the initial scoping; these included the American College of Rheumatology 20% response criteria (ACR20) (the primary outcome for most PsA clinical trials), the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (a measure of physical function), the PASI 75% response criteria (PASI75) (a measure of skin psoriasis improvement), and serious infections. Both the ACR20 and the PASI75 are accepted outcome measures specified by regulatory agencies, including the US FDA, for the approval of treatments for PsA. Serious infections are among the issues of greatest concern.

# ACR/NPF GUIDELINE FOR PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS TREATMENT

# Severe Psoriatic Arthritis

- Erosive disease
- Elevated markers of inflammation (ESR, CRP) attributable to PsA
- Long-term damage that interferes with function (i.e., joint deformities)
- Highly active disease that causes a major impairment in quality of life
- Active PsA at many sites including dactylitis, enthesitis
- Function-limiting PsA at a few sites
- Rapidly progressive disease

# Severe Psoriasis

- PASI of 12 or more
- BSA of 5-10% or more
- Significant involvement in specific areas (e.g., face, hands or feet, nails, intertriginous areas, scalp) where the burden of the disease causes significant disability
- Impairment of physical or mental functioning can warrant a designation of moderate-to-severe disease despite the lower amount of surface area of skin involved

Figure 2. Examples of “severe” psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and psoriasis. The guideline development group defined severe PsA and psoriasis as the presence of 1 or more of the items listed. This is not a formal definition. There have been many definitions of severe psoriasis used over time—the items here are adapted from the 2007 National Psoriasis Foundation expert consensus statement for moderate-to-severe psoriasis (68). In clinical trials, severe psoriasis has been defined as a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of ≥12 and a body surface area (BSA) score of ≥10 (25). ESR = erythrocyte sedimentation rate; CRP = C-reactive protein.

Concern for patients and physicians when selecting among therapies. Other specific harms (e.g., liver toxicity with methotrexate [MTX]) were included as critical outcomes for individual comparisons. We included other outcomes, such as total infections (regardless of severity), when appropriate.

Moving from evidence to recommendations. GRADE methodology specifies that panels make recommendations based on the balance of benefits and harms, the quality of the evidence (i.e., confidence in effect estimates), and patients’ values and preferences. Deciding on the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes requires estimating the relative value patients place on those outcomes. When the literature provided very limited guidance, the experience of the Voting Panel members (including physicians, a rheumatology physician assistant, and the 2 patients present) in managing the relevant cases and issues became an important source of evidence. Values and preferences, crucial to all recommendations, derived from input from the members of the Patient Panel were particularly salient in such situations. GRADE methodology allows the panels the possibility of not coming to a decision, and a summary of the discussion is noted in such cases. However, during the development of this guideline, the Voting Panel came to a conclusion in each case scenario, and such a situation did not arise.

Moving from recommendations to practice. These recommendations are designed to help health care providers work with patients in selecting therapies. The presence or absence of concomitantly occurring conditions, such as IBD, uveitis, diabetes, and serious infections, and the knowledge of previous therapies, influence decisions regarding optimal management. In the context of PsA, the physical examination, which is also required for selecting therapy, includes assessment of the peripheral joints (including for dactylitis), the entheses, the spine, the skin, and the nails. Health care providers and patients must take into consideration all active disease domains, comorbidities, and the patient’s functional status in choosing the optimal therapy for an individual at a given point in time.

# RESULTS/RECOMMENDATIONS

# How to interpret the recommendations

1. A strong recommendation means that the panel was confident that the desirable effects of following the recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects (or vice versa), so the course of action would apply to all or almost all patients, and only a small proportion of clinicians/patients not wanting to follow the recommendation. We use the phrase “should use” or “should be used” for strong recommendations.
2. A conditional recommendation means that the panel believed the desirable effects of following the recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, so the course of action would apply to the majority of the patients, but a small proportion of clinicians/patients may not want to follow the recommendation. Because of this, conditional recommendations are preference sensitive and always warrant a shared decision-making approach. We use the phrase “is recommended over” or “is/would be recommended” for conditional recommendations. We specify conditions under which the less preferred drug may be used by using the phrase “may be used” or “may consider” or “Y (less preferred drug) may be used instead of X (preferred drug)” or “may consider Y instead of X (preferred drug)” for conditional recommendations.
3. Conditional recommendations were usually based on low- to very-low-quality evidence (in rare instances, moderate-quality evidence). Strong recommendations were typically based on moderate- or high-quality evidence.
4. For each recommendation, Supplementary Appendix 5 (on the Arthritis & Rheumatology web site at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40726/abstract) provides details regarding the PICO questions and the GRADE evidence tables.
5. In each case, the Voting Panel’s recommendation was based on a judgment of the most likely net benefit, i.e., 1) more benefit with the medication conditionally recommended with no difference in harms between the medications being compared (e.g., choosing a TNFi over OSMs in treatment-naive patients) or 2) less harm with the medication conditionally recommended and no difference in benefit (e.g., choosing abatacept over a TNFi in patients at risk of or with a history of previous infections, or preferring a different OSM over MTX in patients with PsA and diabetes due to an increased risk of liver toxicity in this subpopulation).
6. This is an evidence-based guideline, in that we explicitly use the best evidence available and present that in a transparent manner for the clinician reader/user (31,32). In some instances, this includes a randomized trial directly comparing.

# Recommendations for pharmacologic interventions

# Active PsA in treatment-naive patients

All recommendations for treatment-naive patients with active PsA are conditional based on low- to very-low-quality evidence.

In treatment-naive patients with active PsA, a TNFi biologic agent is recommended over an OSM as a first-line option (Table 1 and Figure 3). OSMs may be used instead of a TNFi biologic in patients without severe PsA and without severe psoriasis (as defined in Methods and Figure 2; final determination of severity to be made by the patient and the health care provider), those who prefer an oral drug instead of parenteral therapy, or those with contraindications to TNFi treatment, including congestive heart failure, previous serious infections, recurrent infections, or demyelinating disease.

For treatment-naive patients with active PsA, the use of a TNFi biologic or OSM is recommended over an interleukin-17 inhibitor (IL-17i) or IL-12/23i biologic. An IL-17i or IL-12/23i biologic may be used instead of TNFi biologics in patients with severe psoriasis or contraindications to TNFi biologics, and may be used instead of OSMs in patients with severe psoriasis or severe PsA. MTX is recommended over NSAIDs in treatment-naive patients with active PsA. NSAIDs may be used instead of MTX after consideration of possible contraindications and side effect profile in patients without evidence of severe PsA or severe psoriasis and in those at risk for liver toxicity (Table 1 and Figure 3). An IL-17i biologic is recommended over an IL-12/23i biologic. IL-12/23i biologics may be used in patients who have concomitant IBD or who desire less frequent drug administration.

# Active PsA despite treatment with an OSM

All recommendations for patients with active PsA despite treatment with an OSM are conditional based on mostly low- to very-low-quality evidence and, in a few instances, moderate-quality evidence.

In patients with active PsA despite OSM therapy, switching to a TNFi, an IL-17i, or an IL-12/23i biologic is recommended over switching to a different OSM (Table 2 and Figure 4). A different OSM may be used rather than a TNFi, IL-17i, or IL-12/23i in patients who prefer an oral medication or those without evidence of severe PsA or severe psoriasis.

# ACR/NPF GUIDELINE FOR PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS TREATMENT

# Table 1. Recommendations for the initial treatment of patients with active psoriatic arthritis who are OSM- and other treatment–naive (PICOs 9–15)*

|Recommendation|Level of evidence (evidence [refs.] reviewed)†|
|---|---|
|1. Treat with a TNFi biologic over an OSM (MTX, SSZ, LEF, CSA, or APR) (PICO 10a–e)|Low (53–66)|
|2. Treat with a TNFi biologic over an IL-17i biologic (PICO 14)|Very low|
|3. Treat with a TNFi biologic over an IL-12/23i biologic (PICO 13)|Very low|

*Active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is defined as disease causing symptoms at an unacceptably bothersome level as reported by the patient, and judged by the examining clinician to be due to PsA based on ≥1 of the following: swollen joints, tender joints, dactylitis, enthesitis, axial disease, active skin and/or nail involvement, and extraarticular inflammatory manifestations such as uveitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Oral small molecules (OSMs) are defined as methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine (SSZ), leflunomide (LEF), cyclosporine (CSA), or apremilast (APR) and do not include tofacitinib, which was handled separately since its efficacy/safety profile is much different from that of other OSMs listed above. OSM- and other treatment–naive is defined as naive to treatment with OSMs, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), interleukin-17 inhibitors (IL-17i), and IL-12/23i; patients may have received nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, and/or other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions.

† When there were no published studies, we relied on the clinical experience of the panelists, which was designated very-low-quality evidence.

‡ Because there are currently no widely agreed-upon definitions of disease severity, PsA severity should be established by the health care provider and patient on a case-by-case basis. For the purposes of these recommendations, severity is considered a broader concept than disease activity in that it encompasses the level of disease activity at a given time point, as well as the presence of poor prognostic factors and long-term damage. Examples of severe PsA disease include the presence of ≥1 of the following: a poor prognostic factor (erosive disease, elevated levels of inflammation markers such as C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate attributable to PsA), long-term damage that interferes with function (e.g., joint deformities, vision loss), highly active disease that causes major impairment in quality of life (i.e., active psoriatic inflammatory disease at many sites [including dactylitis, enthesitis] or function-limiting inflammatory disease at few sites), and rapidly progressive disease.

§ Because there are currently no widely agreed-upon definitions of disease severity, psoriasis severity should be established by the health care provider and patient on a case-by-case basis. In clinical trials, severe psoriasis has been defined as a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score (25) of ≥12 and a body surface area score of ≥10. In clinical practice, however, the PASI tool is not standardly utilized given its cumbersome nature. In 2007, the National Psoriasis Foundation published an expert consensus statement, which defined moderate-to-severe disease as a body surface area of ≥5% (68). In cases in which the involvement is in critical areas, such as the face, hands or feet, nails, intertriginous areas, scalp, or where the burden of the disease causes significant disability or impairment of physical or mental functioning, the disease can be severe despite the lower amount of surface area of skin involved. The need to factor in the unique circumstances of the individual patient is of critical importance, but this threshold provides some guidance in the care of patients.

# Recommendations for the treatment of patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who are treatment-naive

Discuss with the patient, since all recommendations are conditional based on low to very low quality evidence.

|Start TNFi biologic over OSM; Start OSM over IL17i biologic|Start MTX over NSAIDs|Start IL17i biologic over IL12/23i biologic|
|---|---|---|
|May consider alternative choices in some situations#|May consider alternative choices in some situations#|May consider alternative choices in some situations#|

|Go to Figure 5 for active PsA despite TNFi biologic therapy|Go to Figure 4 for active PsA despite OSM therapy|Go to Figure 6 for active PsA despite IL17i or IL12/23i biologic therapy|

# May consider alternatives (indicated in parentheses), patient has severe psoriasis (IL 17i or IL12/23i biologic); has contraindications to TNFi biologic including recurrent infections, congestive heart failure or demyelinating disease OSM; IL17i biologic; or IL12/23i biologic); prefers oral medications (OSM) or less frequent administrations (IL 12/23i biologic); has concern over starting biologic as the first therapy (OSM); or does not have severe psoriasis or severe PsA (OSM):

## May consider alternatives (indicated in parentheses), patient has severe psoriasis or severe PsA (IL 12/23i biologic or IL 17i biologic); has concomitant active IBD (IL12/23i biologic); or prefers less frequent administrations (IL 12/23i biologic).

May consider NSAIDs in patients with less active disease, after careful consideration of cardiovascular risks and renal risks of NSAIDs.

The order of listing of various conditional recommendations or of different treatment choices within conditional statements does not indicate any sequence in which treatment options would be chosen; each conditional statement stands on its own.

Figure 3. Recommendations for the treatment of patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who are treatment-naive (no exposure to oral small molecules [OSMs] or other treatments). All recommendations are conditional based on low- to very-low-quality evidence. A conditional recommendation means that the panel believed the desirable effects of following the recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, so the course of action would apply to the majority of the patients, but some may not want to follow the recommendation. Because of this, conditional recommendations are preference sensitive and always warrant a shared decision-making approach. Due to the complexity of management of active PsA, not all clinical situations and choices could be depicted in this flow chart, and therefore we show only the key recommendations. For a complete list of recommendations, please refer to the Results section of the text. For the level of evidence supporting each recommendation, see Table 1 and the related section in the Results. This figure is derived from recommendations based on PICO (population/intervention/comparator/outcomes) questions that are based on the common clinical situations. Active PsA was defined as symptoms at an unacceptably bothersome level as reported by the patient, and judged by the examining health care provider to be due to PsA based on the presence of at least 1 of the following: actively inflamed joints, dactylitis, enthesitis, axial disease, active skin and/or nail involvement, and/or extraarticular manifestations such as uveitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). TNFi = tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; IL-17i = interleukin-17 inhibitor; MTX = methotrexate; NSAIDs = nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

In patients with contraindications to TNFi biologics, an OSM may be used rather than a TNFi (except apremilast). Adding another OSM (except apremilast) to current treatment may be considered if the patient has exhibited partial response to the current OSM. Adding apremilast to the current OSM therapy is recommended over switching to apremilast monotherapy since most evidence for benefits of apremilast pertains to apremilast combination therapy. Switching to apremilast monotherapy may be considered instead of apremilast combination therapy if the patient has intolerable side effects with the current OSM.

*Active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is defined as disease causing symptoms at an unacceptably bothersome level as reported by the patient, and judged by the examining clinician to be due to PsA based on ≥1 of the following: swollen joints, tender joints, dactylitis, enthesitis, axial disease, active skin and/or nail involvement, and extraarticular inflammatory manifestations such as uveitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

Oral small molecules (OSMs) are defined as methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine, leflunomide, cyclosporine, or apremilast and do not include tofacitinib, which was handled separately since its efficacy/safety profile is much different from that of other OSMs listed above. TNFi = tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; IL-17i = interleukin-17 inhibitor.

† When there were no published studies, we relied on the clinical experience of the panelists, which was designated very-low-quality evidence.

‡ Because there are currently no widely agreed-upon definitions of disease severity, PsA severity should be established by the health care provider and patient on a case-by-case basis. For the purposes of these recommendations, severity is considered a broader concept than disease activity in that it encompasses the level of disease activity at a given time point, as well as the presence of poor prognostic factors and long-term damage. Examples of severe PsA disease include the presence of ≥1 of the following: a poor prognostic factor (erosive disease, elevated levels of inflammation markers such as C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate attributable to PsA), long-term damage that interferes with function (e.g., joint deformities, vision loss), highly active disease that causes major impairment in quality of life (i.e., active psoriatic inflammatory disease at many sites [including dactylitis, enthesitis] or function-limiting inflammatory disease at few sites), and rapidly progressive disease.

§ Because there are currently no widely agreed-upon definitions of disease severity, psoriasis severity should be established by the health care provider and patient on a case-by-case basis. In clinical trials, severe psoriasis has been defined as a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score (25) of ≥12 and a body surface area score of ≥10. In clinical practice, however, the PASI tool is not standardly utilized given its cumbersome nature. In 2007, the National Psoriasis Foundation published an expert consensus statement, which defined moderate-to-severe disease as a body surface area of ≥5% (68). In cases in which the involvement is in critical areas, such as the face, hands or feet, nails, intertriginous areas, scalp, or where the burden of the disease causes significant disability or impairment of physical or mental functioning, the disease can be severe despite the lower amount of surface area of skin involved. The need to factor in the unique circumstances of the individual patient is of critical importance, but this threshold provides some guidance in the care of patients.

TNFi = tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; IL-17i = interleukin-17 inhibitor; MTX = methotrexate.

A biologic agent in combination with MTX may be used instead of biologic monotherapy if the patient has severe psoriasis, has had a partial response to current MTX therapy, or has concomitant uveitis (since uveitis may respond to MTX therapy), or in patients receiving treatment with a monoclonal antibody TNFi biologic, especially infliximab and adalimumab, to potentially delay or prevent the formation of antidrug antibodies.

Active PsA despite treatment with a TNFi biologic agent as monotherapy or in combination therapy with rheumatoid arthritis. All recommendations for patients with active PsA despite TNFi biologic treatment are conditional based on low- to very-low-quality evidence.

In patients with active PsA despite treatment with TNFi biologic monotherapy, an IL-17i biologic is recommended over an IL-12/23i biologic, abatacept, or tofacitinib, and an IL-12/23i biologic is recommended over abatacept or tofacitinib. An IL-12/23i biologic may be considered instead of an IL-17i biologic if the patient has IBD or desires less frequent drug administration. Abatacept may be considered instead of an IL-17i or IL-12/23i biologic.

All recommendations are conditional based on low- to very-low-quality evidence. A conditional recommendation means that the panel believed the desirable effects of following the recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, so the course of action would apply to the majority of the patients, but some may not want to follow the recommendation. Because of this, conditional recommendations are preference sensitive and always warrant a shared decision-making approach. Due to the complexity of management of active PsA, not all clinical situations and choices could be depicted in this flow chart, and therefore we show only the key recommendations. For a complete list of recommendations, please refer to the Results section of the text. For the level of evidence supporting each recommendation, see Table 3 and the related section in the Results. IL-17i = interleukin-17 inhibitor; IV = intravenous.

# Active PsA despite treatment with an IL-17i biologic

IL-17i biologic may be used instead of switching to a TNFi or IL-12/23i biologic if the patient had a secondary efficacy failure with the current IL-17i biologic, severe psoriasis, or a contraindication to TNFi treatment. MTX may be added to the current IL-17i regimen instead of switching to a TNFi or IL-12/23i biologic agent as monotherapy (Table 4 and Figure 6). All recommendations for patients with active PsA despite IL-17i biologic treatment are conditional based on very-low-quality evidence.

# Active PsA despite treatment with an IL-12/23i biologic

In patients with active PsA despite treatment with an IL-12/23i biologic, switching to a TNFi biologic is recommended over adding MTX to the current regimen or switching to an IL-17i biologic. Treatment may be switched to an IL-12/23i biologic instead of a TNFi biologic if the patient has severe psoriasis or a contraindication to TNFi biologic treatment.

*Active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is defined as disease causing symptoms at an unacceptably bothersome level as reported by the patient, and judged by the examining clinician to be due to PsA based on ≥1 of the following: swollen joints, tender joints, dactylitis, enthesitis, axial disease, active skin and/or nail involvement, and extraarticular inflammatory manifestations such as uveitis or inflammatory bowel disease.

IL-17i = interleukin-17 inhibitor; TNFi = tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; MTX = methotrexate.

† When there were no published studies—as was the case with all of the recommendations presented in this table—we relied on the clinical experience of the panelists, which was designated very-low-quality evidence.

‡ Because there are currently no widely agreed-upon definitions of disease severity, psoriasis severity should be established by the health care provider and patient on a case-by-case basis. In clinical trials, severe psoriasis has been defined as a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score (25) of ≥12 and a body surface area score of ≥10. In clinical practice, however, the PASI tool is not standardly utilized given its cumbersome nature. In 2007, the National Psoriasis Foundation published an expert consensus statement, which defined moderate-to-severe disease as a body surface area of ≥5% (68). In cases in which the involvement is in critical areas, such as the face, hands or feet, nails, intertriginous areas, scalp, or where the burden of the disease causes significant disability or impairment of physical or mental functioning, the disease can be severe despite the lower amount of surface area of skin involved. The need to factor in the unique circumstances of the individual patient is of critical importance, but this threshold provides some guidance in the care of patients.

# Recommendations for the treatment of patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) despite treatment with interleukin- 17 inhibitor (IL-17i) or IL-12/23i biologic monotherapy

All recommendations are conditional based on low- to very-low-quality evidence. A conditional recommendation means that the panel believed the desirable effects of following the recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, so the course of action would apply to the majority of the patients, but some may not want to follow the recommendation. Because of this, conditional recommendations are preference sensitive and always warrant a shared decision-making approach. Due to the complexity of management of active PsA, not all clinical situations and choices could be depicted in this flow chart, and therefore we show only the key recommendations. For a complete list of recommendations, please refer to the Results section of the text. For the level of evidence supporting each recommendation, see Table 4 and the related section in the Results. TNFi = tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; MTX = methotrexate.

May consider alternatives (indicated in parentheses) if the patient has contraindications to TNFi biologic including recurrent infections, congestive heart failure, or demyelinating disease (switching to IL17i biologic; or switching to different IL17i biologic or adding MTX to the current regimen); if the patient had had secondary efficacy failure (initial response, but lack of response/effectiveness with continued use) to the current IL 17i (different IL 17i biologic); severe psoriasis (different IL 17i biologic); if the patient had had partial response to the existing regimen (adding MTX to the current regimen); or prefers less frequent administrations (IL 12/23i biologic).

May consider alternatives (indicated in parentheses), if the patient had had secondary efficacy failure to current IL 17i (different IL 17i biologic); severe psoriasis (different IL 17i biologic); or if the patient had had partial response to the existing regimen (adding MTX to the current regimen).

May consider alternatives (indicated in parentheses), if the patient had had contraindications to TNFi biologic including recurrent infections, congestive heart failure, or demyelinating disease (switching to IL17i biologic or adding MTX to the current regimen); severe psoriasis not responding to the current therapy (switching to IL 17i biologic or adding MTX to the current regimen); May consider adding MTX in patients with only partial response to the current therapy or in those who potentially have not had enough time to adequately respond.

The order of listing of various conditional recommendations or of different treatment choices within conditional statement does not indicate any sequence in which treatment options would be chosen; each conditional statement stands on its own.

# Active PsA with psoriatic spondylitis/axial disease despite treatment with NSAIDs

All recommendations for patients with active PsA with psoriatic spondylitis/axial disease despite NSAID treatment are conditional based on very-low-quality evidence.

The ACR/Spondylitis Association of America/Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network recommendations for patients with axial spondyloarthritis should be followed for patients with axial PsA. OSMs are not effective for axial disease. In patients with active axial PsA despite NSAID treatment, a TNFi biologic is recommended over an IL-17i or IL-12/23i biologic, and an IL-17i biologic is recommended over an IL-12/23i biologic.

# Treat-to-target

This recommendation for patients with active PsA is conditional based on low-quality evidence. In patients with active PsA, using a treat-to-target strategy is recommended over not following a treat-to-target strategy. One may consider not using a treat-to-target strategy in patients in whom there are concerns related to increased adverse events, costs of therapy, and patient burden of medications associated with tighter control.

We recommend not using an IL-12/23i biologic since 3 randomized trials of an IL-12/23i biologic (ustekinumab) in patients with axial spondyloarthritis (a related condition) were stopped because the key primary and secondary end points were not achieved; the safety profile was reportedly consistent with that observed in past ustekinumab studies.

*Active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is defined as disease causing symptoms at an unacceptably bothersome level as reported by the patient, and judged by the examining clinician to be due to PsA based on ≥1 of the following: swollen joints, tender joints, dactylitis, enthesitis, axial disease, active skin and/or nail involvement, and extraarticular inflammatory manifestations such as uveitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

†When there were no published studies, we relied on the clinical experience of the panelists, which was designated very-low-quality evidence.

‡Axial disease is generally treated according to the American College of Rheumatology/Spondylitis Association of America/Spondyloarthritis Research and Treatment Network recommendations for spondyloarthritis (SpA).

§ Because there are currently no widely agreed-upon definitions of disease severity, psoriasis severity should be established by the health care provider and patient on a case-by-case basis. In clinical trials, severe psoriasis has been defined as a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score of ≥12 and a body surface area score of ≥10. In clinical practice, however, the PASI tool is not standardly utilized given its cumbersome nature. In 2007, the National Psoriasis Foundation published an expert consensus statement, which defined moderate-to-severe disease as a body surface area of ≥5%. In cases in which the involvement is in critical areas, such as the face, hands or feet, nails, intertriginous areas, scalp, or where the burden of the disease causes significant disability or impairment of physical or mental functioning, the disease can be severe despite the lower amount of surface area of skin involved. The need to factor in the unique circumstances of the individual patient is of critical importance, but this threshold provides some guidance in the care of patients.

¶ Oral small molecules (OSMs) are defined as methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine, leflunomide, cyclosporine, or apremilast and do not include tofacitinib, which was handled separately since its efficacy/safety profile is much different from that of other OSMs listed above. OSM- and biologic treatment–naive is defined as naive to treatment with OSMs, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), interleukin-17 inhibitors (IL-17i), and IL-12/23i; patients may have received nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), glucocorticoids, and/or other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions.

# It should be noted that for the enthesitis questions (PICO 49, 50, and 51), the existing evidence was mainly drawn from the apremilast studies, as no randomized controlled trial report described enthesitis outcomes for the other OSMs.
---
# ACR/NPF GUIDELINE FOR PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS TREATMENT

# Active PsA with predominant enthesitis in treatment-naive patients and despite treatment with an OSM (Table 5)

All recommendations for patients with active PsA with predominant enthesitis are conditional based on low- to very-low-quality evidence. (This section names apremilast among all OSMs specifically for recommendations, since of the OSMs, only apremilast has shown efficacy for enthesitis.)

In treatment-naive PsA patients with predominant enthesitis, a TNFi biologic is recommended over an OSM as a first-line option. Apremilast may be used instead of a TNFi biologic if the patient prefers an oral therapy or has contraindications to TNFi. Oral NSAIDs are recommended over starting an OSM unless the patient has cardiovascular disease, peptic ulcer disease, renal disease (or impairment), or severe psoriasis or PsA, in which case apremilast may be given instead of NSAIDs. Tofacitinib is recommended over apremilast for treatment-naive patients with predominant enthesitis. Apremilast may be used instead of tofacitinib in patients with recurrent infections.

# Active PsA with concomitant active IBD (Table 5)

All recommendations for patients with active PsA with concomitant active IBD are strong based on moderate-quality evidence, except for 2 conditional recommendations based on very-low-quality evidence.

Active PsA in OSM- and biologic treatment–naive patients with concomitant active IBD. In patients with active PsA with concomitant active IBD who have not received OSM or biologic treatment, a monoclonal antibody TNFi biologic (excludes etanercept, which is a fusion molecule/soluble receptor biologic) is recommended over an OSM (Table 5). An OSM may be used in patients without severe PsA who prefer oral therapy or have contraindications to TNFi biologics.

Active PsA despite treatment with an OSM in patients with concomitant active IBD. In patients with active PsA with concomitant active IBD despite treatment with an OSM, a monoclonal antibody TNFi biologic or an IL-12/23i biologic should be used over an IL-17i biologic, and a monoclonal antibody TNFi biologic should be used over a TNFi soluble receptor biologic (etanercept) (all strong recommendations [Table 5]). A monoclonal antibody TNFi biologic is recommended over an IL-12/23i biologic (conditional recommendation). An IL-12/23i biologic may be used instead of a monoclonal antibody TNFi biologic in patients with contraindications to TNFi biologics or who prefer less frequent drug administration.

# Active PsA with comorbidities (Table 6)

All recommendations for patients with active PsA with comorbidities are conditional based on low- to very-low-quality evidence, except those for patients with serious infections, which are strong based on moderate-quality evidence.

Active PsA in OSM- and biologic treatment–naive patients with concomitant diabetes. In patients with active PsA with concomitant active diabetes who have not received OSM or biologic treatment, an OSM other than MTX is recommended over a TNFi biologic, due to the concern about the higher prevalence of fatty liver disease and liver toxicity with MTX use in this patient population (39,40) (Table 6). A TNFi biologic may be used instead of an OSM in the presence of severe PsA or severe psoriasis or when diabetes is well controlled (i.e., with a potentially lower risk of infections).

Active PsA in OSM- and biologic treatment–naive patients with frequent serious infections. In patients with active PsA who have frequent serious infections and have not received OSM or biologic treatment, an OSM should be used over a TNFi biologic as a first-line treatment since there is a black box warning against the use of a TNFi biologic in patients with frequent serious infections (strong recommendation). An IL-12/23i or IL-17i biologic is recommended over a TNFi biologic (conditional recommendation [Table 6]). A TNFi biologic may be used instead of an IL-12/23i biologic in patients with severe PsA and instead of an IL-17i biologic in patients with concomitant IBD.

# Active PsA in patients requiring killed or live attenuated vaccinations when starting biologic treatment (Table 7)

All recommendations for vaccinations in patients with active PsA are conditional based on very-low-quality evidence.

It is recommended that the biologic treatment be started and the killed vaccines administered (as indicated based on patient age, sex, and immunization history per recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [41]) in patients with active PsA over delaying the biologic to give the killed vaccines. Delaying the start of the biologic is recommended over not delaying to administer a live attenuated vaccination in patients with active PsA (Table 7). If PsA manifestations are severe and delaying the start of the biologic is not desirable, starting the biologic and administering the live attenuated vaccines at the same time might be considered.

OSM- and other treatment–naive is defined as naive to treatment with OSMs, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), interleukin-17 inhibitors (IL-17i), and IL-12/23i; patients may have received nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, glucocorticoids, and/or other pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic interventions.

§ Because there are currently no widely agreed-upon definitions of disease severity, PsA severity should be established by the health care provider and patient on a case-by-case basis. For the purposes of these recommendations, severity is considered a broader concept than disease activity in that it encompasses the level of disease activity at a given time point, as well as the presence of poor prognostic factors and long-term damage. Examples of severe PsA disease include the presence of ≥1 of the following: a poor prognostic factor (erosive disease, elevated levels of inflammation markers such as C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate attributable to PsA), long-term damage that interferes with function (e.g., joint deformities, vision loss), highly active disease that causes major impairment in quality of life (i.e., active psoriatic inflammatory disease at many sites [including dactylitis, enthesitis] or function-limiting inflammatory disease at few sites), and rapidly progressive disease.

¶ Because there are currently no widely agreed-upon definitions of disease severity, psoriasis severity should be established by the health care provider and patient on a case-by-case basis. In clinical trials, severe psoriasis has been defined as a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score (25) of ≥12 and a body surface area score of ≥10. In clinical practice, however, the PASI tool is not standardly utilized given its cumbersome nature. In 2007, the National Psoriasis Foundation published an expert consensus statement, which defined moderate-to-severe disease as a body surface area of ≥5% (68). In cases in which the involvement is in critical areas, such as the face, hands or feet, nails, intertriginous areas, scalp, or where the burden of the disease causes significant disability or impairment of physical or mental functioning, the disease can be severe despite the lower amount of surface area of skin involved. The need to factor in the unique circumstances of the individual patient is of critical importance, but this threshold provides some guidance in the care of patients.

# Recommendations for nonpharmacologic interventions in patients with active PsA regardless of pharmacologic treatment status (Table 8)

It is recommended that patients with active PsA use some form or combination of exercise, physical therapy, occupational therapy, massage therapy, and acupuncture over not using these modalities as tolerated. Low-impact exercise (e.g., tai chi, yoga, swimming) is recommended over high-impact exercise (e.g., running). High-impact exercises may be performed instead of low-impact exercises by patients who prefer the former.

have no contraindications to high-impact exercises (Table 8).

Clinicians should encourage patients to stop smoking, offering cessation aids, due to a demonstrated effectiveness of smoking cessation in randomized trials in other conditions and in the general population (42–44) (strong recommendation). In PsA patients who are overweight or obese, weight loss is recommended in order to potentially increase pharmacologic response.

All strong recommendations in this guideline are also listed separately in Supplementary Appendix 6, at Supplementary Appendix 6.

The guideline will be updated as new evidence from comparative studies becomes available.

# DISCUSSION

We present herein the first ACR/NPF guideline for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. The goal of this guideline is to assist health care providers in managing active PsA in their patients, including optimizing therapy. PsA is a heterogeneous inflammatory disease, and its different clinical features (e.g., peripheral arthritis, psoriasis, nail disease, enthesitis, dactylitis, axial disease) sometimes respond differently to therapy. Despite an expansion in the number of new therapies for PsA, there remains limited comparative efficacy/effectiveness evidence to inform treatment decisions. Thus, most of our recommendations are based on low-quality evidence and are conditional. The conditional recommendations convey that, although the suggested course of action will be best for many patients, there will be some patients in whom, considering their comorbidities and/or their values and preferences, the alternative represents the best choice. Findings from the Patient Panel meeting were discussed throughout the Voting Panel.

*Active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is defined as disease causing symptoms at an unacceptably bothersome level as reported by the patient, and judged by the examining clinician to be due to PsA based on ≥1 of the following: swollen joints, tender joints, dactylitis, enthesitis, axial disease, active skin and/or nail involvement, and extraarticular inflammatory manifestations such as uveitis or inflammatory bowel disease.

† When there were no published studies, we relied on the clinical experience of the panelists, which was designated very-low-quality evidence.

Meeting to ensure that patient input was incorporated into the final PsA guideline. Examples of patient feedback included strong value on therapies that are effective (e.g., prevent further damage, and improve quality of life, social participation, and function) and safe (especially having low adverse event profiles). In particular, patients discussed the negative impact of adverse events (e.g., fatigue, nausea, and malaise) on quality of life and social participation, and thus the risk for these adverse events weighed heavily in patients’ decision-making. The concept of treat-to-target was challenging for patients. Although they saw value in improved outcomes, they also thought this strategy could increase costs to the patient (e.g., copayments, time traveling to more frequent appointments, etc.) and potentially increase adverse events. Therefore, a detailed conversation with the patient is needed to make decisions regarding treatment targets. To help ensure that the recommendations were patient-centered, 2 patients were members of the Voting Panel.

While using a treat-to-target approach over not using a treat-to-target approach was discussed by the Voting Panel, we did not address specific targets to be recommended or used. There have been 2 international meetings to discuss potential targets: the use of either minimal disease activity (MDA) or disease activity in psoriatic arthritis (DAPSA) (45,46). The treatment target for PsA would likely be MDA or DAPSA, although a different target may be chosen through patient–provider discussion. The ACR/NPF PsA guideline conditionally recommends a TNFi biologic over an OSM agent in patients with active PsA.

We recognize that these recommendations do not account for the full complexity of PsA or the full range of possible therapies (e.g., glucocorticoids were not addressed). The high degree of heterogeneity in the presentation and course of PsA coupled with the involvement of multiple domains in a single patient cannot be captured in a single algorithm. In addition, reporting of disease measures and differences in inclusion/exclusion criteria in PsA clinical trials makes it difficult to compare therapies across trials. The impact of alternative therapies on important outcomes such as joint damage still remains to be elucidated. Vaccination recommendations with tofacitinib were not included, as it was not yet approved for PsA when the PICO questions were drafted and only a limited number of PICO questions could be feasibly included for voting. Additional topics, including vaccination in the setting of tofacitinib, will be addressed in a subsequent guideline update.

The ACR has decided to use GRADE methodology in the development of guidelines for the management of rheumatic diseases. The GRADE methodology specifies that panels make recommendations based on a consideration of the balance of relative benefits and harms of the treatment options under consideration, the quality of the evidence (i.e., confidence in the evidence based on the lowest quality of the critical outcomes—high, moderate, low, or very low), and patients’ values and preferences. The rating of the quality of evidence for each clinical situation (PICO question) helped to inform the strength of the recommendation (strong or conditional).

In patients with concomitant IBD, the Voting Panel made strong recommendations favoring a monoclonal antibody TNFi or an IL-12/23i biologic over an IL-17i biologic or a TNFi receptor biologic (etanercept). This was based on moderate-quality evidence showing that TNFi biologics and ustekinumab (an IL-12/23i biologic) are effective for the management of IBD, whereas etanercept (a TNFi receptor biologic) and secukinumab (an IL-17i biologic) are not.

When the evidence was low or very low quality, the panel could not be confident in the judgment of net benefit—thus the conditional recommendation. Often, low- or very low-quality evidence came from indirect evidence, for instance from rheumatoid arthritis or, in the absence of studies, from clinical experience. When data on comparative benefits and comparative harms were similar between two medications, the panel explicitly preferred and recommended the medication for which longer-term harms were more well-known, and in which the physician experience in patients with PsA was longer, supplementing with harms data/experience from related rheumatic conditions, where these medications are commonly used.

In each case, judgments of net benefit involved explicit consideration of values and preferences, including input from Patient Panel members of the Voting Panel as well as the full Patient Panel that met prior to the Voting Panel meeting.
---
Limitations of the guideline include the limited comparative evidence to inform selection of therapies (i.e., primary comparative benefit/efficacy and harms evidence) and the inability to include all possible clinical scenarios due to the necessity of keeping the task feasible. Because the American Academy of Dermatology and the NPF are currently developing a guideline addressing therapy for psoriasis, our guideline did not address treatment of isolated psoriasis. Another limitation is that we searched only English-language literature. The major limitation of the work arises from the limitations in the evidence.

In this guideline, we often used indirect comparisons among trials/therapies, frequently relying on network meta-analysis. Stratified analyses among subgroups (e.g., treatment-naive, inadequate response to a TNFi biologic agent) were rarely reported separately in primary trials, limiting our ability to perform network meta-analyses in these important subgroups. For most clinical scenarios (PICO questions) there were few or no head-to-head comparison studies identified in the literature review. Thus, the quality of evidence was most often low or very low, and only occasionally moderate (Supplementary Appendix 5; http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40726/abstract). This led to nearly all recommendations being conditional, with a few strong recommendations in cases in which there was sufficient evidence (including that from outside of PsA) to make the Voting Panel confident in selecting one option over the comparator. A flow chart or ranking of treatments requires strong recommendation; when recommendations are conditional/weak it means that the right course of action differs between patients. When the right course of action differs between patients, it is inappropriate to make the flow chart and establish treatment ranking or a hierarchy of treatment options (14).

The 2018 ACR/NPF guideline for the treatment of PsA will assist patients and their health care providers in making challenging disease management decisions. More comparative data are needed to inform treatment selection. Several ongoing trials, including a trial to compare a TNFi biologic combination therapy with a TNFi biologic monotherapy and MTX monotherapy (52), will inform treatment decisions. We anticipate future updates to the guideline when new evidence is available.
