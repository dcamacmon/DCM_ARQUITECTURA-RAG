Guidelines and recommendations developed and/or endorsed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) are intended to provide guidance for patterns of practice and not to dictate the care of a particular patient. The ACR considers adherence to the recommendations within this guideline to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the clinician in light of each patient’s individual circumstances. Guidelines and recommendations are intended to promote beneficial or desirable outcomes but cannot guarantee any specific outcome. Guidelines and recommendations developed and endorsed by the ACR are subject to periodic revision as warranted by the evolution of medical knowledge, technology, and practice. ACR recommendations are not intended to dictate payment or insurance decisions, and drug formularies or other third-party analyses that cite ACR guidelines should state this. These recommendations cannot adequately convey all uncertainties and nuances of patient care. The ACR is an independent, professional, medical and scientific society that does not guarantee, warrant, or endorse any commercial product or service.

# Objective

To provide evidence-based recommendations on the use of vaccinations in children and adults with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs).

# Methods

This guideline follows American College of Rheumatology (ACR) policy guiding management of conflicts of interest and disclosures and the ACR guideline development process, which includes the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology. It also adheres to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) criteria. A core leadership team consisting of adult and pediatric rheumatologists and a guideline methodologist drafted clinical population, intervention, comparator, outcomes (PICO) questions. A review team performed a systematic literature review for the PICO questions, graded the quality of evidence, and produced an evidence report. An expert Voting Panel reviewed the evidence and formulated recommendations.

# Results

This guideline includes expanded indications for some vaccines in patients with RMDs, as well as guidance on whether to hold immunosuppressive medications or delay vaccination to maximize vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy. Safe approaches to the use of live attenuated vaccines in patients taking immunosuppressive medications are also addressed. Most recommendations are conditional and had low quality of supporting evidence.

# Conclusion

Application of these recommendations should consider patients’ individual risk for vaccine-preventable illness and for disease flares, particularly if immunosuppressive medications are held for vaccination. Shared decision-making with patients is encouraged in clinical settings.

# INTRODUCTION

Rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMDs) (1,2) and immunosuppressive medications used to treat them place patients at higher risk of vaccine-preventable infections and of more serious complications of infection. Vaccines have long been used to reduce illness from common viral and bacterial pathogens, and standardized vaccine schedules for children and adults have been widely adopted for use in both healthy people and those with chronic medical conditions (3,4). However, the immunogenicity and safety of vaccines may differ in patients with RMDs compared to the general population, and patients with RMDs may benefit from modified vaccine indications and/or adjustments to vaccination or medication schedules. Issues related to vaccination and medication management at the time of vaccination apply across diseases, and thus, this guideline is meant to help in the management of vaccines for all children and adults with RMDs in the US. The target audience is limited to rheumatology providers in the US because the epidemiology of vaccine-preventable infections and the availability of specific vaccines vary across the globe. However, providers in other countries may also find the guideline useful. A list of specific medications, vaccinations, and RMDs addressed in this guideline is found in Table 1, and a glossary of terms commonly used in this guideline can be found in Table 2.

The 2022 ACR guideline for vaccination in adults and children with RMDs highlights the following: 1) pneumococcal vaccination should be administered to all RMD patients taking immunosuppressive medication; 2) recombinant zoster vaccination is recommended for RMD patients >18 years of age taking immunosuppressive medication; 3) methotrexate should be held.

Avacopan and bimekizumab, the pneumococcal vaccines PCV15 and PCV20, and the smallpox/monkeypox vaccine were not included in the formal evidence review because they were not approved at the time of the project plan. Antipyretic medications such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs and acetaminophen were also not included. Although a few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have demonstrated blunted antibody responses with antipyretics, this was seen after primary vaccination only, and not after booster (5) or influenza vaccination (6). Observational studies also suggest that they have minimal-to-no impact on antibody responses to vaccination (5,7). Vaccinations against COVID-19 are not included in this guideline because, given the fast-changing nature of the pandemic and the COVID-19–related literature, there was concern that recommendations would be obsolete well before guideline publication. COVID-19 vaccinations will be incorporated into a future guideline update once the pertinent literature has stabilized. We refer readers to the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) COVID-19 vaccine guidance (8) and to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website (9) for information on COVID-19 vaccines for patients with compromised immunity. Finally, we refer readers to the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) (10) and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) (11) vaccination guidelines for any other topics not addressed herein. This study did not involve human subjects, and therefore, approval from Human Studies Committees was not required.

# Table 2. Glossary of terms

|Term|Definition|
|---|---|
|Adjuvant|An ingredient used in some vaccines that helps create a stronger immune response in patients receiving the vaccine|
|Immunogenicity|The ability of a vaccine to elicit an immune response|
|Reactogenicity|Typical symptoms (e.g., fever, sore arm, muscle aches) that occur shortly (days) after vaccine administration either at the site of vaccination or systemically|
|Seroconversion|Development of antibodies to a pathogen, elicited by a vaccine (or infection), in the blood of an individual who previously did not have detectable antibodies|
|Seroprotection|An antibody level capable of protecting against infection or disease|
|Titer|Numerical value indicating the level of antibody against a particular pathogen|

GRADE, a recommendation is categorized as strong if the panel is very confident that the benefits of an intervention clearly outweigh the harms (or vice versa); a conditional recommendation denotes uncertainty regarding the balance of benefits and harms, such as when the evidence quality is low or very low, or when costs are expected to impact the decision. Thus, for conditional recommendations, incorporation of patient preferences is particularly essential, acknowledging that patient preferences are an important part of all clinical decision-making. Rosters of the Core Leadership Team, Literature Review Team, Voting Panel, and Patient Panel are included in Supplementary Appendix 4, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25045.

# The following guiding principles were used in this guideline:

1. Indicated vaccinations should be given to patients whenever possible;
2. This guideline is complementary to recommendations from the ACIP (10) and the AAP (15);
3. The decision to hold a medication before or after vaccination should consider the patient’s disease, disease activity, and risk for vaccine-preventable infection; and
4. Shared decision-making with patients is a key component of any vaccination strategy.

# METHODS

This guideline follows ACR policy guiding management of conflicts of interest and disclosures (https://www.rheumatology.org/Practice-Quality/Clinical-Support/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines) and the ACR guideline development process, which includes Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology (12,13), and adheres to the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) criteria (14). Supplementary Appendix 1, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25045, includes a detailed description of the methods. Briefly, the guideline team drafted clinical population, intervention, comparator, outcomes (PICO) questions (see Supplementary Appendix 2, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25045). The literature review team performed a systematic literature review for the PICO questions, graded the quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, very low), and produced the evidence report (see Supplementary Appendix 3, available on the Arthritis Care & Research website at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25045). An expert Voting Panel reviewed the evidence report and then formulated and voted on recommendations. Additionally, a virtual Patient Panel reviewed the evidence and provided patient perspectives and preferences for consideration by the Voting Panel. The Patient Panel consisted of 9 patients with a variety of adult and pediatric RMDs and was moderated by a member of the core team (EC).

Voting Panel consensus required ≥70% agreement on both the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation, as per ACR practice. According to the guidelines, expanded indications for specific vaccines in patients with RMDs receiving immunosuppression include:

# Influenza vaccination

For patients with RMD age ≥65 years and patients with RMD age >18 years and <65 years who are taking immunosuppressive medication, giving high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccination is conditionally recommended over giving regular-dose influenza vaccination. Any influenza vaccine is preferred over no influenza vaccine, and vaccination “today” is preferred over delay. Therefore, if high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccine is not available in the clinic during a patient visit when influenza vaccination is indicated, then standard-dose influenza vaccine should be administered. This caveat also applies in instances when insurance restrictions may preclude administration of high-dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccination to patients <65 years of age.

High-dose influenza vaccine is a quadrivalent vaccine containing 4 times the antigen as the standard-dose vaccine. Two RCTs in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients showed higher seroconversion rates in younger patients receiving high-dose vaccination compared to standard-dose vaccination with no safety signal (16,17). The adjuvanted influenza vaccine is a standard-dose quadrivalent vaccine containing the MF59 adjuvant, which elicits a strong antigenic response without the need for a higher antigen dose. No studies of the adjuvanted influenza vaccination in RMD patients age <65 years were identified in the literature search, but there.

have been no safety issues seen with adjuvants in general, although they may be associated with greater reactogenicity (18).

demonstrated mild disease flares in some patients around the time of vaccination (28), and reactogenicity is common with this vaccine (26).

# Pneumococcal vaccination

For patients with RMD age &lt;65 years who are taking immunosuppressive medication, pneumococcal vaccination is strongly recommended.

Patients with RMDs taking immunosuppressive medication may be at increased risk of pneumococcal infection (19,20). Multiple observational studies have evaluated the prime boost method of pneumococcal vaccination, with a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13 or PCV15), followed 2 months later by a dose of the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). A single-dose PCV20 vaccine is now approved in the US (21) and is likely to supplant this 2-dose strategy in the not-too-distant future, at least in adults. PCV15 and PCV20 polysaccharide conjugates are not currently approved for use in children in the US; but this too may soon change.

The CDC currently recommends PCV15 followed by PPSV23 one year later, or PCV20, for adults &lt;65 years taking immunosuppressive medications who were not previously vaccinated against pneumococcus, however, we recommend reference to CDC guidelines when choosing a specific pneumococcal vaccination strategy because this area is rapidly changing (21).

There are few studies evaluating the impact of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) on conjugate pneumococcal vaccines. The ACIP recommends administering pneumococcal vaccination to individuals age &gt;18 years with certain chronic medical conditions and those taking immunosuppressive medication (10,22). The CDC and AAP recommend the primary PCV13 series to all children &lt;2 years of age and PPSV23 vaccination to children age ≥2 years with underlying medical conditions (15).

# Recombinant varicella-zoster virus (VZV) vaccination

For patients with RMD age &gt;18 years who are taking immunosuppressive medication, administering the recombinant VZV vaccine is strongly recommended.

Patients with RMDs such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and RA are at higher risk of herpes zoster than older adults recommended for vaccination (23). Although the literature search identified no publications that specifically addressed recombinant VZV vaccination in patients with RMDs who are &lt;50 years of age, this vaccine has been shown to be safe and effective in immunosuppressed patients undergoing renal transplantation (24) and autologous stem cell transplantation (25) and in patients with hematologic malignancies, many of whom are &lt;50 years of age (26,27).

The ACIP recommends recombinant VZV vaccination for individuals &gt;18 years and &lt;50 years of age who are immunocompromised and for the general public age ≥50 years (10).

One retrospective study published after completion of the literature review suggested that holding methotrexate around the time of influenza vaccination on vaccine immunogenicity (38,39). Assessment of flare risk and shared decision-making with the patient is recommended when deciding whether methotrexate should be held.

Non-rheumatology providers (e.g., general pediatricians and internists) are encouraged to give influenza vaccination even if they are unsure as to whether to hold methotrexate, and then to consult with the patient’s rheumatologist, rather than miss a vaccination opportunity.

# Table 3. Medication management at the time of non–live attenuated vaccine administration

| |Influenza vaccination|Other non–live attenuated vaccinations|
|---|---|---|
|Methotrexate|Hold methotrexate for 2 weeks after vaccination*|Continue methotrexate|
|Rituximab|Continue rituximab†|Time vaccination for when the next rituximab dose is due, and then hold rituximab for at least 2 weeks after vaccination|
|Immunosuppressive medications other than methotrexate and rituximab|Continue immunosuppressive medication| |

= Conditional recommendation.

* Hold only if disease activity allows. Non-rheumatology providers, e.g., general pediatricians and internists, are encouraged to give the influenza vaccination and then consult with the patient’s rheumatology provider about holding methotrexate to avoid a missed vaccination opportunity.

† Give influenza vaccination on schedule. Delay any subsequent rituximab dosing for at least 2 weeks after influenza vaccination if disease activity allows.

Holding methotrexate at the time of COVID-19 vaccination is associated with greater vaccine immunogenicity (40,41).

The literature review identified no studies that directly addressed the impact of holding medications other than methotrexate at the time of influenza vaccination. Two RCTs performed in patients initiating TNFi versus placebo demonstrated similar responses to influenza vaccination in the 2 arms (42,43). Data on other biologic DMARDs and their relationship to influenza vaccine responses are much more limited (44–47).

# Glucocorticoids

Whether to administer non–live attenuated vaccinations to patients taking glucocorticoids or defer vaccination to a later time point to maximize vaccine immunogenicity.

For patients with RMD who are taking the equivalent of prednisone ≤10 mg daily, administering any non–live vaccinations is strongly recommended.

For patients with RMD who are taking the equivalent of prednisone >10 mg daily but <20 mg daily, administering any non–live attenuated vaccinations is conditionally recommended.

For patients with RMD taking the equivalent of prednisone ≥20 mg daily, administering influenza vaccination is conditionally recommended.

For patients with RMD who are taking the equivalent of prednisone ≥20 mg daily, deferring non–live attenuated vaccinations, other than influenza vaccination, until glucocorticoids are tapered to the equivalent of prednisone <20 mg daily is conditionally recommended.

Influenza vaccine responses are greater when the vaccine is administered later rather than earlier after rituximab (48–50). Rituximab has also been shown to blunt responses to pneumococcal polysaccharide PPSV23 vaccination (51,52). Because of the seasonal nature of influenza, influenza vaccination is conditionally recommended to be given on schedule to patients receiving rituximab. For other non–live attenuated vaccinations, deferring vaccination until the next rituximab dose will improve vaccine immunogenicity. However, patients could also be vaccinated in the interest of acquiring some immunity and then revaccinated later (influenza vaccination could also be repeated using this same rationale). Whenever possible, vaccinations should be administered prior to rituximab initiation. Rituximab should be delayed for at least 2 weeks after any vaccination to allow time for the patient to develop an immune response, assuming that disease activity allows.

Given the importance of timely influenza vaccination, a conditional recommendation was made to administer influenza vaccination to patients receiving the equivalent of prednisone ≥20 mg daily. For vaccines other than for influenza, a conditional recommendation was made.

= Conditional recommendation.

* Or the equivalent dose of any other glucocorticoid formulation, or the equivalent pediatric dose.

† Defer vaccination until glucocorticoids are tapered to the equivalent of prednisone <20 mg daily.

It is understood, however, that some patients may not be able to delay, e.g., children who require vaccination for school entry.

The AAP Red Book (15) and the Infectious Diseases Society of America (68) define low-level immunosuppression as methotrexate ≤0.4 mg/kg/week, azathioprine ≤3 mg/kg/day, prednisone <20 mg/day (or <2 mg/kg/day for patients weighing <10 kg), or alternate-day glucocorticoid therapy (68).

# Disease activity

Whether to defer vaccination in patients with high disease activity to maximize vaccine immunogenicity and/or avoid worsening disease activity.

For patients with RMD, giving non–live attenuated vaccinations is conditionally recommended regardless of patients’ disease activity.

Patients with RMD often express concern about whether vaccination can induce a disease flare, but the vast majority of studies failed to show any increased rate of flare after influenza vaccination. The results were similar for other vaccinations, although the quality of the evidence was low.

Strong concerns, however, were expressed among the Patient Panel about the potential for vaccines to cause a disease flare, and shared decision-making is particularly important in this setting.

Most studies suggest that increased disease activity does not impact vaccine immunogenicity (53,62), although one study did show lower seroconversion rates in pediatric lupus patients with a Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index score of >8 who were vaccinated against influenza (57).

# Managing immunosuppressive therapy at the time of live attenuated vaccination to avoid vaccine-associated illness

For patients with RMD who are taking immunosuppressive medication, deferring live attenuated vaccines is conditionally recommended.

For patients with RMD, holding immunosuppressive medication for an appropriate period before and 4 weeks after live attenuated virus vaccination is conditionally recommended.

For some live attenuated virus vaccines, such as for oral polio, oral typhoid, and influenza, there are inactivated alternatives.

Antiviral antibodies contained in IVIG can interfere with replication of live attenuated vaccines and reduce their efficacy (75). The CDC recommends a delay of 8–11 months (depending on IVIG dose) between receipt of high-dose IVIG and live attenuated virus vaccination (76).

† For patients taking the equivalent of prednisone <20 mg/day or <2 mg/kg/day for patients weighing <10 kg or alternate-day glucocorticoid therapy (i.e., “low-level immunosuppression” [15,68]), these low doses can be continued if vaccination is critical and the risk of a disease flare or adrenal insufficiency when the patient is not taking glucocorticoids is high.

‡ For patients taking methotrexate≤0.4 mg/kg/week or azathioprine ≤3 mg/kg/day (“low-level immunosuppression” [15,68]), hold times can be shortened if vaccination is critical and the risk of a disease flare when the patient is not taking immunosuppression is high.

§ For medications with >1 dosing interval approved by the Food and Drug Administration, the longest interval should be chosen (e.g., hold subcutaneous adalimumab for 2 weeks, although it can be dosed every 1 or every 2 weeks).

¶ In children with autoinﬂammatory disorders or systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis in whom the risk of disease flare if biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs are held is very high, shorter hold times can be considered if live attenuated vaccination is critical.

# The recommendation to hold IVIG prior to vaccination is designed to enhance vaccine efﬁcacy, not safety. In some situations, such as during a measles outbreak, earlier vaccination would be preferred over delay.

Close contacts of immunosuppressed patients should receive all age-appropriate vaccination (with the exception of smallpox) to avoid the vaccine-preventable diseases, as recommended by the ACIP (78). The ACIP also notes that no speciﬁc precautions are needed except if a household contact develops a rash after varicella vaccination, in which case direct contact should be avoided until the rash resolves (78). They also reinforce the recommendation to household members to wash their hands after diaper changing when an infant has received a rotavirus vaccine (78).

Speciﬁc recommendations for holding medications if live attenuated vaccines are given. Although the evidence around the safety of conventional DMARDs and TNFi at the time of live attenuated virus vaccination is reassuring, the total number of RMD patients who have been studied is small, and the Voting Panel conditionally recommended against administering live attenuated virus vaccines to patients receiving live attenuated virus vaccines.

For neonates/infants with second- and/or third-trimester antenatal exposure to TNFi, giving live attenuated rotavirus vaccine within the first 6 months of life is conditionally recommended.

# ACR GUIDELINE FOR VACCINATIONS IN RHEUMATIC AND MUSCULOSKELETAL DISEASES

For neonates/infants with second- and/or third-trimester antenatal exposure to rituximab, delaying rotavirus vaccine until >6 months of age is conditionally recommended.

Vaccination against rotavirus typically occurs at 2 and 4 months, or at 2, 4, and 6 months. Rotavirus is rare in the US because of widespread immunization, and for this reason, the AAP recommends delaying rotavirus vaccination for 12 months after any in utero exposure to biologic DMARDs (except for certolizumab, which does not cross the placenta) (15). Three observational studies encompassing 58 children exposed to biologic DMARDs (most taking TNFi) who received live rotavirus vaccines reported no clear adverse events (79–81). Only minimal amounts of infliximab have been detected in the breast milk of treated patients (82).

The literature review identified no data on the effect of in utero rituximab exposure on later vaccine responses. Rituximab is a chimeric IgG1 molecule that can cross the placenta, and it has been associated with low or absent B lymphocyte levels in newborns who were exposed during the second or third (but not the first) trimester (83). Most reports demonstrate B cell recovery in these infants within 6 months after birth (83). Extrapolating from vaccine responses in adults treated with rituximab (48–50), infants exposed to rituximab are unlikely to respond to vaccination until 6 months postexposure. Although delayed rotavirus vaccine administration has been associated with an increased risk of intussusception, this complication remains quite rare (84).

After giving birth, most RMD patients turn to their general pediatrician rather than to their adult rheumatology provider for infant vaccination recommendations, and pediatricians may not be aware of the impact of in utero medication exposure on vaccine safety and immunogenicity. Therefore, recommendations regarding infant rotavirus vaccination after in utero exposure to either TNFi or rituximab should be discussed with the pregnant RMD patient prior to delivery. Specifically, the pregnant patient should be educated as to the fact that medications that cross the placenta may affect vaccination schedules for their infants. A copy of the current vaccine guideline summary (https://www.rheumatology.org/Portals/0/Files/Vaccinations-Guidance-Summary.pdf) may serve as a useful resource for the pregnant RMD patient to share with their pediatrician in advance of delivery.

Most recommendations in this guideline are aimed at maximizing vaccine immunogenicity because the literature revealed few vaccine safety signals, at least regarding non-live vaccinations. Many vaccines are required for school entry to protect not only the health of the individual but also that of the broader community. Public health requirements may supersede some recommendations made here. Insurance barriers could inhibit implementation of these recommendations, such as to administer high dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccine or recombinant VZV to RMD patients <65 years of age taking immunosuppressive medications. In such instances, this guideline could be used as a resource to aid in prior authorization.

Not included in this guideline are recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination in patients with RMD. Readers can refer to the CDC for the most up-to-date recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination, including for patients taking immunosuppressive medications.

|Recommendations|Level of evidence†|PICO|numbers|
|---|---|---|---|
|For patients with RMD, giving multiple vaccinations on the same day rather than giving each individual vaccination on a different day is conditionally recommended.|PICO 22. Very low (indirect evidence only)‡|PICO 22. Should patients with RMD receive standardized regimens of vaccine combinations?|952|

= Strong recommendation.

= Conditional recommendation.

* PICO = population, intervention, comparator, outcomes; RMD = rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease; VZV = varicella‐zoster virus; HPV = human papillomavirus; MTX = methotrexate; TNFi = tumor necrosis factor inhibitors; DMARDs = disease‐modifying antirheumatic drugs.

† The terms ‘moderate’, ‘low’, and ‘very low’ are based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) definitions for quality of evidence. Moderate quality means that “further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate.” Low quality means that “further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate.” Very low quality means that “we are very uncertain about the estimate.” In the systematic review for this guideline, a judgment of moderate quality required at least some evidence from randomized controlled trials, and a judgment of low quality required at least some evidence from well‐designed observational studies with appropriate comparator groups.

‡ Indirect evidence indicates that there is evidence from other populations with RMD or other health conditions, or evidence that does not fully address the comparison specified in a PICO question.

medication (9). Recommendations about holding immunosuppressive medications at the time of non–live attenuated virus vaccination in this guideline (Table 3) differ from those recommended around the time of COVID-19 vaccination in the ACR COVID-19 vaccine guidance (8). This is because prior to the introduction of COVID-19 vaccines in late 2020, there was little population-level immunity to the SARS–CoV-2 virus, and maximizing vaccine efficacy was a public health imperative. In contrast, when considering routine vaccinations, the desire to avoid an RMD flare weighs more heavily in the balance. Therefore, there are very few instances where this guideline recommends holding medication at the time of non–live attenuated virus vaccination. Studies that demonstrate diminished vaccine responses in RMD patients receiving immunosuppression (other than rituximab) generally demonstrate diminished, but not completely abrogated, responses.

Finally, the literature review demonstrated that much more evidence is needed to guide practice in this area. Knowledge gaps where further research is needed are as follows: 1) standardization of trial design and outcome measures to test the efficacy and durability of response to all vaccines across all age groups; 2) safety of primary and booster live attenuated virus vaccination in children taking methotrexate and/or biologic DMARDs; 3) assessment of the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and disease flares following standard-dose, high-dose, and adjuvanted influenza vaccination, recombinant VZV vaccination, and primary and booster COVID-19 vaccination in RMD patients taking immunosuppressive medication; and 4) RCTs to test the safety and efficacy of holding DMARDs around the time of vaccination.
