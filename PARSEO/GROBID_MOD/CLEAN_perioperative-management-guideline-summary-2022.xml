		<ns0:body><ns0:div><ns0:p>This updated guideline addresses the perioperative management of disease modifying medications for adults with rheumatic diseases, specifically inflammatory arthritis (IA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) undergoing elective total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA). A panel of rheumatologists, orthopaedic surgeons, and infectious disease specialists updated the systematic literature review and included currently available medications for the clinically relevant population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes (PICO) questions, updating the 2017 recommendations*. As patients with IA and SLE are at increased risk of infection after THA and TKA, these recommendations aim to balance the risk of perioperative infection and the risk of disease flares, recognizing that all flares have an impact on quality of life but a flare in a patient with severe SLE at risk for organ damage warrants unique considerations. This updated guideline includes recently introduced immunosuppressive medications to help decision-making by clinicians and patients regarding perioperative disease modifying medication management for patients with IA and SLE at the time of elective THA or TKA. ***For patients with RA, AS, PsA, or all SLE for whom anti-rheumatic therapy was held prior to undergoing TJA, restarting the anti-rheumatic therapy once the wound shows evidence of healing, any sutures/staples are out, there is no significant swelling, erythema or drainage, and there is no ongoing non-surgical site infection, which is typically about 14 days.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>MEDICATIONS TO CONTINUE THROUGH SURGERY</ns0:head></ns0:div></ns0:body><ns0:back>
