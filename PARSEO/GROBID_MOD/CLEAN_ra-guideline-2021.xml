		<ns0:body><ns0:div><ns0:head>INTRODUCTION</ns0:head><ns0:p>To support high-quality clinical care, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) regularly updates clinical practice guidelines for the management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), with the most recent update reported in 2015</ns0:p><ns0:p>In keeping with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation [GRADE] methodology), the ACR panel developed recommendations for commonly encountered clinical scenarios</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>METHODS</ns0:head><ns0:p>This guideline follows the ACR guideline development process and ACR policy guiding the management of conflicts of interest and disclosures (<ns0:ref type="url" target="https://www.rheumatology.org/Practice-Quality/Clinical-Support/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines">https://www.rheum atolo gy.org/Pract ice-Quali ty/ Clini cal-Suppo rt/Clini cal-Pract ice-Guide lines</ns0:ref>)<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24596/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24596/ abstract</ns0:ref>), includes a detailed description of the methods. Briefly, the core leadership team drafted clinical population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes (PICO) questions. The literature review team performed systematic literature reviews for the PICO questions, selected and evaluated individual studies and graded the quality of the body of evidence available for each outcome, and produced the evidence report that summarizes these assessments (see Supplementary Appendix 2, available on the Arthritis Care &amp; Research website at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24596/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24596/ abstract</ns0:ref>). The core team defined the critical study outcome as disease activity for most PICO questions. Because the ACR has, in a separate project, endorsed several disease activity measures for use in clinical practice, this guideline does not define levels of disease activity or the instruments a clinician should use to measure it<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24596/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ acr.24596/ abstract</ns0:ref>). When available, cost-effectiveness studies were included with the evidence reports. Cost estimates (average wholesale prices) were retrieved from Lexicomp (see Supplementary Appendix 4, available on the Arthritis Care &amp; Research website at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24596/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24596/ abstract</ns0:ref>). The panel considered these estimates from a societal perspective, i.e., based on the list price, and not the copay.</ns0:p><ns0:p>An in-person panel of 10 patients with RA, moderated by the project's principal investigator, reviewed the evidence report (along with a summary and interpretation by the moderator) and provided patient perspectives for consideration by the voting panel. The voting panel (13 clinicians and 2 patients) reviewed the evidence reports and patient perspectives and voted on recommendation statements. Rosters of the core leadership, literature review team, and panel members are listed in Supplementary Appendix 5, available on the Arthritis Care &amp; Research website at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24596/abstract">http://online libr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24596/ abstract</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Several guiding principles, definitions, and assumptions were established a priori (Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ns0:ref>).

The recommendation is conditional because some patients, especially those with poor prognostic factors, may prioritize more rapid onset of action and greater chance of improvement associated with combination therapy</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Methotrexate monotherapy is strongly recommended over methotrexate plus a non-TNF inhibitor bDMARD or tsDMARD for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity</ns0:head><ns0:p>There is very low-certainty evidence supporting the superiority of methotrexate plus a non-TNF inhibitor bDMARD or tsDMARD over methotrexate monotherapy in DMARD-naive patients; thus, methotrexate monotherapy is strongly preferred given the lack of proven benefit and additional risks and costs associated with the addition of a non-TNF inhibitor bDMARD or tsDMARD in this patient population.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Glucocorticoids Initiation of a csDMARD without short-term (&lt;3 months) glucocorticoids is conditionally recommended over initiation of a csDMARD with short-term glucocorticoids for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity</ns0:head><ns0:p>While the voting panel agreed that glucocorticoids should not be systematically prescribed, the recommendation is conditional because all members acknowledged that short-term glucocorticoids are frequently necessary to alleviate symptoms prior to the onset of action of DMARDs. Treatment with glucocorticoids should be limited to the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. The toxicity associated with glucocorticoids was judged to outweigh potential benefits.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Initiation of a csDMARD without longerterm (â‰¥3 months) glucocorticoids is strongly recommended over initiation of a csDMARD with longer-term glucocorticoids for DMARD-naive patients with moderate-to-high disease activity</ns0:head><ns0:p>Although some patients may require longer-term glucocorticoids, this strong recommendation against longer-term glucocorticoid therapy is made because of its significant toxicity.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Recommendations for DMARD-naive patients with low disease activity (Table 2)</ns0:head></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Hydroxychloroquine is conditionally recommended over other csDMARDs, sulfasalazine is conditionally recommended over methotrexate, and methotrexate is conditionally recommended over leflunomide for DMARDnaive patients with low disease activity</ns0:head><ns0:p>Hydroxychloroquine is conditionally recommended over other csDMARDs because it is better tolerated and has a more favorable risk profile in patients with RA. Sulfasalazine is recommended over methotrexate because it is less immunosuppressive, and the patient panel felt that many patients with low disease activity would prefer to avoid the side effects associated with methotrexate. The recommendations are conditional because methotrexate may be the preferred initial therapy in patients at the higher end of the low disease activity range and in those with poor prognostic factors</ns0:p><ns0:p>| 929</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Recommendation for patients who have been treated with csDMARDs, excluding methotrexate, and who have moderate-to-high disease activity (Table 2)</ns0:head><ns0:p>Recommendations are the same as for DMARD-naive patients except for this population.

This recommendation refers only to the initial prescribing of methotrexate and is not meant to limit further dose escalation, which often provides additional efficacy</ns0:p><ns0:p>A split dose of oral methotrexate over 24 hours or weekly subcutaneous injections, and/or an increased dose of folic/folinic acid, is conditionally recommended over switching to alternative DMARD(s) for patients not tolerating oral weekly methotrexate Despite the very low certainty of evidence supporting these strategies for alleviating side effects related to methotrexate, split dosing, changing to the subcutaneous route of administration, and increased doses of folic/folinic acid are the preferred initial strategies over switching to another DMARD because of the efficacy, long-term safety, and low costs associated with methotrexate. The recommendation is conditional because patient preferences play an important role in the decision whether to continue methotrexate or switch to other DMARDs.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Switching to subcutaneous methotrexate is conditionally recommended over the addition of/ switching to alternative DMARD(s) for patients taking oral methotrexate who are not at target</ns0:head><ns0:p>This recommendation is consistent with the voting panel's overarching principle of maximizing use of methotrexate prior to switching/adding DMARDs. However, there are no data comparing outcomes in patients who switch to subcutaneous methotrexate versus another treatment strategy that includes other DMARDs. The recommendation is conditional because patient preferences and the magnitude of previous response to methotrexate play an important role in this decision. Recommendations for treatment modification in patients treated with DMARDs who are not at target (Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ns0:ref>)</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Treat-to-target</ns0:head><ns0:p>A treat-to-target approach is strongly recommended over usual care for patients who have not been previously treated with bDMARDs or tsDMARDs This recommendation applies to dose optimization of methotrexate and to the subsequent addition of DMARDs when required. The recommendation is strong despite low-certainty evidence because of the recognized importance of systematic monitoring and adjustment of treatment to minimize inflammation to prevent joint damage, as well as other long-term sequelae including cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>A treat-to-target approach is conditionally recommended over usual care for patients who have had an inadequate response to bDMARDs or tsDMARDs</ns0:head><ns0:p>The recommendation is conditional because of the uncertain incremental benefits of treat-to-target over usual care in this patient population. In this context, usual care refers to commonly employed practice patterns, i.e., adjustment of treatment based on shared decision-making, albeit typically without systematic monitoring of disease activity using validated measures to reach a predefined target. Moreover, 1) the number of remaining available treatment options, 2) the impact of noninflammatory causes of pain, comorbidities, and/or damage on the accuracy of validated disease activity assessments, and 3) the patient's threshold for changing medications may have a more significant influence on the decision to follow a treat-to-target approach in this population compared to patients who are bDMARD-and tsDMARD-naive.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>A minimal initial treatment goal of low disease activity is conditionally recommended over a goal of remission</ns0:head><ns0:p>An initial target of low disease activity is preferred because remission by established criteria may not be achievable for many patients</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Modification of DMARD(s)</ns0:head></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Addition of a bDMARD or tsDMARD is conditionally recommended over triple therapy (i.e., addition of sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine) for patients taking maximally tolerated doses of methotrexate who are not at target</ns0:head><ns0:p>The panel vigorously debated whether to recommend addition of a bDMARD or tsDMARD versus sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine (triple therapy) for patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate monotherapy in view of very low-certainty evidence favoring bDMARDs or tsDMARDs, randomized controlled trials demonstrating equivalent long-term outcomes across both treatment strategies, and significantly less societal cost associated with triple therapy<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ns0:ref>)</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Switching to a bDMARD or tsDMARD of a different class is conditionally recommended over switching to a bDMARD or tsDMARD belonging to the same class for patients taking a bDMARD or tsDMARD who are not at target</ns0:head><ns0:p>The recommendation is based on very low-certainty evidence supporting greater improvement in disease activity and drug survival among patients switching classes.

The recommendation is conditional because the continued use of glucocorticoids may be required for patients who do not respond to DMARDs even after maximizing methotrexate dosage and switching DMARD classes.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Addition of/switching to DMARDs (with or without intraarticular [IA] glucocorticoids) is conditionally recommended over the use of IA glucocorticoids alone for patients taking DMARDs who are not at target</ns0:head><ns0:p>This recommendation was based on the premise that DMARDs should be adjusted to reduce disease activity, irrespective of treatment with IA glucocorticoids. The recommendation is conditional because patients may choose to defer adding/switching DMARDs if they obtain relief from IA injection(s).</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Recommendations for tapering/discontinuing DMARDs (Table 5)</ns0:head><ns0:p>Because of the moderate-to-high risk for flare and the potential for irreversible long-term damage associated with stopping all DMARDs, the following recommendations presume that patients maintain a therapeutic dose of at least 1 DMARD. In addition, the recommendations specify that patients be at target (low disease activity or remission) for at least 6 months prior to tapering. Patients in remission for &lt;6 months should not routinely be considered for dose reduction or withdrawal.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Although the optimal time at target prior to tapering has not been established, the voting panel considered 6 months to be a reasonable minimal length of time to ensure stable disease control. "Dose reduction" refers to lowering the dose or increasing the dosing interval of a DMARD. "Gradual discontinuation" denotes gradually lowering the dose of a DMARD and subsequently stopping it.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Continuation of all DMARDs at their current dose is conditionally recommended over a dose reduction of a DMARD, dose reduction is conditionally recommended over gradual discontinuation of a DMARD, and gradual discontinuation is conditionally recommended over abrupt discontinuation of a DMARD for patients who are at target for at least 6 months</ns0:head><ns0:p>These recommendations are based on studies demonstrating a higher risk of flare in patients who are 1) lowering the dose of a DMARD versus continuing DMARDs at the same dose, and 2) abruptly versus gradually discontinuing a DMARD</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Gradual discontinuation of sulfasalazine is conditionally recommended over gradual discontinuation of hydroxychloroquine for patients taking triple therapy who wish to discontinue a DMARD</ns0:head><ns0:p>Gradually discontinuing sulfasalazine is recommended because of its poorer treatment persistence due to adverse events</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Gradual discontinuation of methotrexate is conditionally recommended over gradual discontinuation of the bDMARD or tsDMARD for patients taking methotrexate plus a bDMARD or tsDMARD who wish to discontinue a DMARD</ns0:head><ns0:p>In the absence of direct evidence, gradually discontinuing methotrexate is preferred because a bDMARD or tsD-MARD is typically added following an inadequate response to methotrexate. Thus, the continued use of the bDMARD or tsDMARD is more likely to maintain disease control than the continued use of methotrexate. The recommendation is conditional because gradual discontinuation of the bDMARD or tsDMARD may be favored depending on comorbidities, risk for infection, cost concerns, as well as patient and clinician preferences. The voting panel cautioned that many patients treated with certain monoclonal antibodies may require ongoing treatment with methotrexate to prevent the formation of antidrug antibodies</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Recommendations for specific patient populations (Table 6)</ns0:head></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Subcutaneous nodules</ns0:head></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Methotrexate is conditionally recommended over alternative DMARDs for patients with subcutaneous nodules who have moderate-tohigh disease activity</ns0:head></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Switching to a non-methotrexate DMARD is conditionally recommended over continuation of methotrexate for patients taking methotrexate with progressive subcutaneous nodules</ns0:head><ns0:p>While accelerated nodulosis has been observed in patients starting methotrexate</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Pulmonary disease</ns0:head></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Methotrexate is conditionally recommended over alternative DMARDs for the treatment of inflammatory arthritis for patients with clinically diagnosed mild and stable airway or parenchymal lung disease, or incidental disease detected on imaging, who have moderate-to-high disease activity</ns0:head><ns0:p>Studies indicate that preexisting lung disease is a risk factor for methotrexate-related pneumonitis</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Heart failure</ns0:head></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Addition of a non-TNF inhibitor bDMARD or tsDMARD is conditionally recommended over addition of a TNF inhibitor for patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV heart failure and an inadequate response to csDMARDs</ns0:head></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Switching to a non-TNF inhibitor bDMARD or tsDMARD is conditionally recommended over continuation of a TNF inhibitor for patients taking a TNF inhibitor who develop heart failure</ns0:head><ns0:p>These recommendations are based on the risk of worsening heart failure observed in randomized clinical trials of TNF inhibitors in patients with NYHA class III or IV heart failure without RA</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Lymphoproliferative disorder</ns0:head></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Rituximab is conditionally recommended over other DMARDs for patients who have a previous lymphoproliferative disorder for which rituximab is an approved treatment and who have moderate-to-high disease activity</ns0:head><ns0:p>Rituximab is preferred over other DMARDs, regardless of previous DMARD experience, because it would not be expected to increase the risk of recurrence or worsening of these lymphoproliferative disorders.

Although an increased risk of infection has been described in RA patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, it is not known if a switch in DMARDs in patients who are at target is more effective in lowering infection risk while maintaining disease control than continuation of rituximab.

Several new topics are included in this update, including recommendations for administration of methotrexate, use of methotrexate in patients with subcutaneous nodules, pulmonary disease, and NAFLD, use of rituximab in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia, and treatment of RA in patients with NTM lung disease. Areas covered in the 2015 guidelines that are not covered in this update include recommendations for patients with hepatitis C and solid malignancies. The panel did not vote on specific recommendations for patients with hepatitis C because curative antiviral therapy is now widely available. The panel did deliberate over PICO questions related to use of DMARDs in patients with solid malignancies. However, given the changing landscape of personalized treatments for many solid malignancies, the voting panel felt that a generalized recommendation was not possible.</ns0:p><ns0:p>On February 4, 2021, the FDA released a Drug Safety Alert noting a possible increased risk of major cardiovascular events and malignancies (excluding non-melanoma skin cancer) in patients with RA (over the age of 50 years with at least 1 risk factor for cardiovascular disease) participating in a randomized controlled trial designed to compare the safety of tofacitinib to adalimumab</ns0:p><ns0:p>The panel also considered PICO questions related to current use of checkpoint inhibitor therapy, but the variability in current practice patterns and differences in treatment for specific cancer types precluded the development of specific recommendations for patients who are candidates for, or are currently receiving checkpoint inhibitor therapy. We anticipate that additional recommendations for patients with systemic rheumatic diseases and solid malignancies will be developed as further data become available. There were vigorous discussions pertaining to recommendations for specific DMARDs in patients with moderate-tohigh disease activity despite csDMARDs and with a history of serious infection. However, the evidence was insufficient to support a recommendation. Future studies (using large registries and network meta-analyses) are needed to support specific recommendations for this patient population.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The recommendation statements in this update are not directly comparable to the ACR 2015 guidelines  because they do not retain the early versus established RA subgroups. Nevertheless, there are some notable differences. First, the 2015 guidelines recommend csDMARD monotherapy, preferably with methotrexate, for patients with both low and moderate/high disease activity, whereas this update recommends an initial trial of hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine for those with low disease activity. Second, the 2015 guidelines recommended DMARD tapering for patients who are in remission. In this update, tapering recommendations are made for patients who are in low disease activity or remission in the face of a paucity of data about when and how best to taper. The panel recommended that careful tapering might be considered if the patient wishes to cut back on their use of DMARDs. However, patients should be closely evaluated during any taper, and if a flare occurs, the prior regimen should be reinstituted promptly. Last, this update includes several recommendations against the use of glucocorticoid therapy. These recommendations were made in recognition of the frequent difficulty tapering glucocorticoids leading to undesirable prolonged use and the increasing evidence of the negative impact of glucocorticoids on long-term patient outcomes, including risk for infection, osteoporosis, and cardiovascular disease, in RA and other rheumatic diseases</ns0:p><ns0:p>While consensus was easily reached on the majority of statements, 2 issues required prolonged discussion and debate. The decision on whether patients with an inadequate response to methotrexate should escalate to a bDMARD, tsDMARD, or triple therapy engendered much discussion with contrasting points of view. In the end, a recommendation was made in favor of a bDMARD or tsDMARD because of the more rapid onset of benefit and concerns related to the poor tolerability and durability of triple therapy in real-world practice</ns0:p><ns0:p>Members of the voting panel agreed with the patient panel on the direction and strength of all but 2 recommendations. Patients were in favor of initial treatment with combination csD-MARDs over methotrexate monotherapy because they placed greater value on the incremental benefits associated with combination therapy compared to clinicians. This preference was also stated in the 2015 guidelines</ns0:p><ns0:p>When clinically relevant, recommendations specify the level of disease activity in the patient population (Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ns0:ref>). However, evidence tables include pooled data from studies that often use different measures of disease activity; thus, specific definitions of low versus moderate-to-high disease activity are not provided for specific recommendations. Despite the large body of literature related to pharmacologic treatments for RA, the review team did not identify high-certainty evidence for many of the questions addressed. This discrepancy is due to the differences between clinically important PICO questions and the specific objectives of clinical trials. For example, few studies have examined how to best dose and administer methotrexate, the most effective and safe use of DMARDs in high-risk populations, and the risk-benefit tradeoffs associated with glucocorticoid use. Moreover, many trials could not be matched to specific PICO questions because of differences between the trials and the PICO questions' specified study populations and treatment comparisons. Thus, many recommendations are based largely on very low-certainty or lowcertainty evidence. Incorporating medical evidence and expert input and consensus into clinical guidelines is core to the GRADE process and strengthens recommendations, particularly when there is limited evidence. Important gaps in knowledge are described in Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In summary, this update includes recommendations related to initiation and adjustment of DMARD therapy in patients with RA. It also emphasizes the importance of minimizing use of glucocorticoids. It is expected that additional data may modify the direction and/or strength of specific recommendations. The ACR will update the recommendations and answer these and other questions as new data are published.</ns0:p></ns0:div></ns0:body><ns0:back>
