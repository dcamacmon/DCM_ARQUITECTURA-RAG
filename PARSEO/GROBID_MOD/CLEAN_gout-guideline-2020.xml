A full description of the methods is presented in Supplementary Appendix 1 (available on the Arthritis Care &amp; Research web site at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/ abstract</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p><ns0:p>Briefly, the Core Team, Expert Panel, and Voting Panel (consisting of rheumatologists, a general internist, a nephrologist, a physician assistant, and a patient representative) generated 57 population, intervention, comparator, and outcomes (PICO) questions to address the following: indications for ULT (5 questions), approaches to initiating ULT (7 questions), ongoing ULT management (18 questions), gout flares (10 questions), and lifestyle and other medication strategies in patients with gout (9 questions) and in individuals with asymptomatic hyperuricemia<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/ abstract</ns0:ref>). An in-person Patient Panel of 8 male patients with gout, moderated by one of the voting panel members (JAS), reviewed the evidence report (along with a summary and interpretation by the moderator) and provided patient perspectives and preferences.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The Core Team prespecified outcomes as critical or important for each PICO question for the systematic literature review. Outcomes varied across PICO topic (for details, see Supplementary Appendix 3, at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/ doi/10.1002/acr.24180/ abstract</ns0:ref>). Gout flare and serum urate (SU) concentration (and tophus for PICO question 1) were specified as critical outcomes for all PICO questions specific to ULT. Pain was identified as critical for PICO questions specific to gout flare. Gout flare was specified as the only critical outcome for management of lifestyle factors. All other outcomes were specified as important. Without standardized definitions for gout flare as an outcome</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conducted systematic literature reviews (including 2 network meta-analyses<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/abstract">http://onlin e libr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/ abstract</ns0:ref>). The first NMA evaluated the impact of starting ULT versus no ULT and the relative impact of the various ULT agents (for details, see Supplementary Appendix 6, available at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/ doi/10.1002/acr.24180/ abstract</ns0:ref>). The second NMA evaluated antiinflammatory agents in gout flare management (for details, see Supplementary Appendix 7, available at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley. com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/ abstract</ns0:ref>). To accomplish this second NMA, we grouped similar agents into nodes (e.g., acetic acid derivatives, profens, cyclooxygenase 2 agents, glucocorticoids, and interleukin-1 [IL-1] inhibitors).</ns0:p><ns0:p>The lowest level of evidence for the outcomes deemed critical to patients determined the certainty of evidence for each PICO question<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="table">3</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_2">4</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_3">5</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_4">6</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_5">7</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_6">8</ns0:ref>, and the certainty of evidence for each outcome within each PICO question is in the full evidence report (see Supplementary Appendix 8, available on the Arthritis Care &amp; Research web site at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ acr.24180/ abstract</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p><ns0:p>Additionally, we report results using the more conservative rating of the evidence using the lowest level of evidence for any of the critical outcomes. Applying these more conservative rules, the summary certainty of evidence decreased (in comparison to the reported results) for some of the ULT recommendation statements, which would result in a lower strength of recommendation for 2 recommendations (PICO question 2: ULT indication for patients with erosions, and PICO question 27: switching to pegloticase for ULT failure). The details are available in the evidence report (Supplementary Appendix 8). Medication costs (not part of the systematic literature review), reported as average wholesale pricing as sourced from Lexicomp on August 23, 2019, were provided to the Voting Panel, as cost of treatment was included as part of the evaluation of risks and benefits of treatment medications (see Supplementary Appendix 9, available on the Arthritis Care &amp; Research web site at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/ abstract</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p><ns0:p>PICO questions were drafted into recommendation statements and were sent to the Voting Panel with the evidence report prior to round 1 voting. At a face-to-face meeting, the Voting Panel again reviewed draft recommendations, a summary of the voting results from round 1, the evidence report, and a summary of Patient Panel statements (1 patient from the Patient Panel [JES] and the Patient Panel moderator [JAS] attended the Voting Panel and were available to answer questions about the Patient Panel statements). To become a recommendation (for or against) in this guideline, at least 70% consensus of the Voting Panel was required.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The strength of each recommendation was rated as strong or conditional. Strong recommendations reflect decisions supported by moderate or high certainty of evidence where the benefits consistently outweigh the risks, and, with only rare exceptions, an informed patient and his or her provider would be expected to reach the same decision. Conditional recommendations reflect scenarios for which the benefits and risks may be more closely balanced and/or only low certainty of evidence or no data are available.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendations in this guideline apply to patients with gout, except for a single recommendation regarding the use of ULT in individuals with asymptomatic hyperuricemia, which is defined as an SU concentration of ≥6.8 mg/dl with no prior gout flares or subcutaneous tophi. Patients with evidence of monosodium urate monohydrate (MSU) deposition on advanced imaging may still be considered asymptomatic if they have not had a prior gout flare or subcutaneous tophi.</ns0:p><ns0:p>These guidelines do not directly address the impact of gout or hyperuricemia on other comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension, urolithiasis, or chronic kidney disease (CKD). As we developed these guidelines for use by providers practicing in the US, we considered pharmacologic therapies available in the US, with select exceptions. Although lesinurad was withdrawn from the US market by the manufacturer during the course of guideline development, it remains Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, and we therefore considered the data in relation to relevant PICO questions. To facilitate the 2 NMAs, we also considered medications not available in the US to permit comparisons with other available medications in the network analysis.</ns0:p><ns0:p>| 747</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>RESULTS/RECOMMENDATIONS</ns0:head></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Indications for pharmacologic ULT</ns0:head><ns0:p>Initiating ULT is strongly recommended for gout patients with any of the following: ≥1 subcutaneous tophi; evidence of radiographic damage (any modality) attributable to gout; OR frequent gout flares, with frequent being defined as ≥2 annually.</ns0:p><ns0:p>From the ULT NMA (see Supplementary Appendix 6, available at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/ abstract</ns0:ref>) and randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of pegloticase<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ns0:ref>and Supplementary Figure<ns0:ref type="figure">1</ns0:ref>, available at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/abstract">http://onlinelibrary.wiley. com/doi/10.1002/acr.24180/abstract</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Initiating ULT is conditionally recommended for patients who have previously experienced &gt;1 flare but have infrequent flares (&lt;2/year).</ns0:head><ns0:p>For patients with less frequent flares and no tophi, the potential clinical benefit of ULT would be lower than the ULT benefit for patients with more burdensome gout.

For these patients with frequent gout flares or nonresolving subcutaneous tophi, clinical trials demonstrated improved SU concentrations, low frequency of flares</ns0:p><ns0:p>The above scenarios represent extremes of gout clinical severity resulting in strong "for" and "against" recommendations. The Voting Panel considered intermediary scenarios, but given the potential variability, the panel opted to simply defer to provider judgment balanced with patient preferences, regarding the optimal treatment strategy for individuals not described above. To clarify, as outlined above, there is a strong recommendation to follow a treat-to-target management strategy for all patients receiving ULT. However, the recommendation for treat-to-target strategy is not absolute and not meant to be pursued at "any cost."

Appropriate dosing and duration should be guided by the severity of the flare. For colchicine specifically, the FDA-approved dosing should be followed (1.2 mg immediately followed by 0.6 mg an hour later, with ongoing antiinflammatory therapy until the flare resolves). Based on similar efficacy between agents demonstrated in the NMA , the Voting Panel did not further prioritize between the first-line agents, noting that treatment selection should be driven by patient factors (e.g., comorbidity, access, past experience) as part of shared decisionmaking. Likewise, parenteral glucocorticoids were favored over alternative agents when oral dosing is not possible. In patients experiencing an inadequate response to an initial agent, the Voting Panel cited insufficient evidence to make specific recommendations regarding subsequent antiinflammatory agents to use. If a patient is unable to tolerate or has contraindications to any of the other conventional alternatives, the Voting Panel conditionally recommended the use of IL-1 inhibitors , recognizing concerns over patient access due to cost. Noting limited supporting data</ns0:p><ns0:p>Underscoring the importance of optimal flare management, the Patient Panel emphasized its preference for early intervention given the challenges of engaging a provider in timely manner, including an at-home "medication-in-pocket" strategy for patients who are able to identify the early signs of flare onset.

This resulted in a more focused, less proscriptive document. Where certainty of data is less than moderate or high, conditional recommendations made herein are meant to highlight those decisions that would benefit from a shared patient-provider decision-making process. This would include areas such as diet, lifestyle, or concomitant medications that might affect SU levels, and for which the Patient Panel requested guidance. The Voting Panel aimed to provide guidance without implying any "patient-blaming" for the manifestations of gout given its strong genetic determinants.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Indications for ULT are expanded from the 2012 ACR Guidelines for the Management of Gout, but consistent with the 2016 update of the EULAR gout recommendations</ns0:p><ns0:p>This updated guideline effort also identifies several areas that inform a research agenda for gout management. While data support an active treat-to-target strategy, a question remains as to what may be the optimal SU threshold for patients with more severe disease, in addition to questions about threshold values in specific populations of gout patients. Gout has differential impact on patients by sex, race, or by presence of other comorbidities. This guideline is limited in commenting on specific groups of gout patients, as more studies of specific patient cohorts are needed in order to make differential recommendations. Additional studies are needed to determine the safety of prolonged and profound treatmentrelated hypouricemia (e.g., SU ≤3 mg/dl), an important knowledge gap given that epidemiologic studies have suggested an inverse association of SU concentration with select neurodegenerative disorders</ns0:p><ns0:p>Gout has been characterized as a "curable disease"</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:note place="foot" xml:id="foot_0"><ns0:p>Based on recent nurse-</ns0:p></ns0:note></ns0:body><ns0:back>
