		<ns0:body><ns0:div><ns0:head>INTRODUCTION</ns0:head><ns0:p>Glucocorticoids (GCs) remain a common therapeutic modality for patients with a variety of diseases. Prevention of GC-induced bone loss and fractures has been a focus of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) for many years because patients with osteoporotic fractures have increased risk of morbidity and mortality</ns0:p><ns0:p>Despite increasing treatment options to prevent and treat glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP), many GC-treated patients are not evaluated or treated, resulting in preventable fractures</ns0:p><ns0:p>The ACR first published recommendations for prevention and treatment of GIOP in 1996</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>METHODS</ns0:head><ns0:p>This guideline follows the ACR guideline development process and ACR policy guiding management of conflicts of interest and disclosures (<ns0:ref type="url" target="https://www.rheumatology.org/Practice-Quality/Clinical-Support/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines">https://www.rheumatology.org/Practice-Quality/Clinical-Support/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines</ns0:ref>), including use of Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/</ns0:ref>doi/10.1002/acr.25240/abstract, includes a detailed description of the methods. Briefly, the Core Leadership Team (MBH, LR, MID, HAF, GG, SU) reviewed the 2017 ACR GIOP guideline clinical Patient/Intervention/Comparator/Outcomes (PICO) questions, modified and drafted new PICO questions in topic areas not covered previously (eg, abaloparatide, romosozumab, combination and sequential therapy) (see Supplementary Appendix 2,<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25240/abstract">http:// onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25240/abstract</ns0:ref>). The Literature Review Team updated the systematic literature reviews for each of the previous PICO questions and/or performed new ones for new questions, graded the quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, very low), and produced the evidence report (see Supplementary Appendix 3,<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/</ns0:ref>acr.25240/abstract). The resulting evidence was reviewed, and recommendations were formulated and voted on by an expert Voting Panel. A virtual Patient Panel of three patients with GIOP and one parent of a child treated with GCs reviewed the evidence with a co-principal investigator (LR) and provided patient perspectives and preferences for consideration by the Voting Panel. Voting Panel consensus required ≥70% agreement on both direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation. Rosters of the Core Leadership Team,</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>RECOMMENDATIONS How to interpret the recommendations</ns0:head><ns0:p>According to GRADE, a strong recommendation is usually supported by moderate-to high-certainty evidence, including randomized control trials, the recommended course of action would apply to all or almost all patients, and there is high confidence that the benefits of the intervention clearly outweigh the harms (or vice versa). In rare instances, a strong recommendation or best practices may be made with very-low certainty evidence if the recommendation is considered benign, low cost, and without harms.</ns0:p><ns0:p>A conditional recommendation is supported by lower certainty evidence, has uncertainty regarding the balance of benefits and harms, is sensitive to individual patient preferences, or has costs expected to impact the decision. Thus, conditional recommendations warrant shared decisionmaking with the patient. Notably, most evidence reviewed in this guideline is downgraded for indirectness because 1) identified studies in GIOP rely on a surrogate fracture risk marker, bone mineral density (BMD), because they were not powered for fracture outcomes and 2) available fracture data were exclusively or predominantly from general osteoporosis (OP) studies. Recommendations for fracture risk assessment (Figure<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ns0:ref>)</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Key recommendations</ns0:head><ns0:p>For all adults (≥18 years old) initiating or continuing GC therapy ≥2.5 mg/day for &gt;3 months, we strongly recommended initial clinical fracture risk assessment including symptomatic and asymptomatic fracture history, FRAX (age ≥40 only), and BMD with VFA or spine x-rays over no assessment (PICO 8.1-8.4).</ns0:p><ns0:p>These strong recommendations are based on good clinical practice and the need for clinicians to risk stratify patients beginning or continuing GC therapy, despite the low certainty of the evidence. Initial assessment should occur as soon as possible within 6 months of GC therapy initiation. Clinical fracture risk assessment includes dose, duration, and pattern of GC use, alcohol use, smoking history, hypogonadism, history of prior fractures (traumatic, fragility, asymptomatic), low body weight, significant weight loss, parental history of hip fracture, fall history, thyroid disease, hyperparathyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, malabsorption, chronic liver disease, and inflammatory bowel disease (Figure<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ns0:ref>). BMD with VFA or spinal x-rays are strongly recommended, and, for adults ≥40 years old, FRAX analysis is also recommended. (Figure<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ns0:ref>). If prednisone dose is &gt;7.5 mg daily, FRAX GC correction is recommended (Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ns0:ref>, Figure<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ns0:ref>)</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend treatment for those at moderate or very high risk of fracture with oral or IV BP, ‡ PTH/PTHrP, § or DEN §# PTH/PTHrP Agonists (TER, ABL, Anti-RANKL, DEN)</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend PTH/PTHrP over antiresorptives in patients at very high risk of fracture. We conditionally recommend DEN §# or PTH/PTHrP over oral and IV BP in high risk of fracture. In moderate risk, we conditionally recommend BP, DEN, or PTH/PTHrP in no preferred order among these agents.</ns0:p><ns0:p>-</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Selective estrogen receptor modifier (RAL), Antisclerostin (ROM)</ns0:head><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend IV BP, ROM, RAL over no treatment in high and very high risk of fracture.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Except in patients intolerant of other agents, we conditionally recommend against RAL due to harms of VTE and fatal stroke or ROM due to uncertain harms with increased myocardial infarction, stroke and death.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommended against RAL due to harms of VTE and fatal stroke or ROM due to uncertain harms including increased myocardial infarction, stroke and death (eg, age at diagnosis, growth, body mass index [BMI], disease severity, GC dosing, BMD, symptomatic or asymptomatic vertebral compression fractures) should be taken into account when considering assessment for OP therapy</ns0:p><ns0:formula xml:id="formula_0">*</ns0:formula><ns0:p>As in prior guidelines, we used risk categories of low, moderate, and high using DXA and/or FRAX assessments (see Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ns0:ref>Recommendations for reassessment of fracture risk (Figure<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2</ns0:ref>)</ns0:p><ns0:p>For adults continuing chronic GC ≥2.5 mg/day but &lt;7.5 mg/day and assessed as low fracture risk, who were not recommended to start therapy, or moderate fracture risk who chose not to start OP therapy (except calcium and vitamin D), we strongly recommend fracture risk reassessment every 1 to 2 years (PICO 9.1-9.4).</ns0:p><ns0:p>Despite the low certainty of the evidence, this is a strong recommendation as good clinical practice. Fracture risk reassessment includes clinical fracture risk history, new symptomatic fractures, FRAX, BMD, VFA, and/or spine x-rays. Repeating DXA assessment every 1 to 2 years allows providers to detect the least significant BMD change according to their DXA machine, triggering the need to start OP therapy.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For adults continuing chronic GC ≥2.5 mg/day and assessed as moderate, high, or very high fracture risk who are continuing OP therapy ≥1 year, we strongly recommend fracture risk re-assessment every 1 to 2 years over no risk reassessment (PICO 9.5-9.12).</ns0:p><ns0:p>Despite the low certainty of the evidence, this is a strong recommendation as good clinical practice. Reassessment allows providers to determine if patients continuing GC and OP therapy are maintaining, gaining, or losing BMD, warranting possible changes in OP therapy. Yearly BMD assessment until a stable BMD is reached may be preferred in very high fracture risk patients.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For adults stopping GC and remaining at moderate, high, or very high fracture risk, we strongly recommend continuing OP therapy (PICO 12.1-12.6).  Recommendations for initial treatment (Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ns0:ref>, Figure<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3</ns0:ref>) For all adults and children beginning or continuing chronic GC at a dose of ≥2.5 mg/day for &gt;3 months, we conditionally recommended optimizing age appropriate dietary and supplemental calcium and vitamin D, in addition to lifestyle modifications (PICO 1.1-1. The evidence for calcium and vitamin D supplementation for fracture reduction in GIOP is low to very low. Dietary and supplemented elemental calcium intake of up to 1,000 to 1,200 mg daily is recommended for adults</ns0:p><ns0:p>For adults ≥40 years with very high fracture risk, we conditionally recommend PTH/PTHrP over anti-resorptives (BP or DEN) (PICO 1.13c, 1.14c, 1.15c, 1.18c, 1.19c, 1.20c).</ns0:p><ns0:p>Compared to alendronate, teriparatide increased lumbar and hip BMD and decreased vertebral but not nonvertebral fractures at 36 months in GIOP</ns0:p><ns0:p>For adults ≥40 years with high or very high fracture risk, we strongly recommended oral BP</ns0:p><ns0:p>A strong recommendation for oral BP is based on studies showing a reduction in total and vertebral fractures at 24 months and increased hip and lumbar spine BMD compared to calcium and vitamin D alone in GIOP (evidence report, Appendix S3, page 16). For adults ≥40 years with high fracture risk, we conditionally recommend PTH/PTHrP or DEN over BP (PICO 1.4c-1.28.c).</ns0:p><ns0:p>For adults ≥40 years with high fracture risk, we conditionally recommend IV or oral BP, PTH/PTHrP, or DEN over Raloxifene (RAL) or Romosozumab (ROM) (PICO 1.4c-1.28.c).</ns0:p><ns0:p>High-certainty evidence indicates that oral BP prevents vertebral fractures in GIOP</ns0:p><ns0:p>Compared to BP and RAL, PTH/PTHrP, DEN, and ROM require sequential therapy with an anti-resorptive agent to prevent bone losses. Discontinuation of DEN must be followed by a BP beginning at 6 to 7 months after the last DEN dose to prevent rapidly progressive vertebral fractures. Additionally, IV BP, DEN, and ROM have increased risk of atypical femur fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw compared to oral BP</ns0:p><ns0:p>Very low level evidence does not support using combination therapy (eg, PTH/PTHrP and DEN, PTH/PTHrP and BP) in GIOP. In patients with postmenopausal OP, studies have shown synergistic increases in BMD with combination of PTH with IV BP</ns0:p><ns0:p>For all adults with moderate fracture risk, we conditionally recommend oral or IV BP, PTH/PTHrP, or DEN over no treatment (PICO 1.4b-1.28.b, 2.4b,c-2.<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">17b,</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="figure">c</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p><ns0:p>In all adults with moderate fracture risk, we conditionally recommend against ROM and RAL therapies except in those intolerant of other OP medications, due to possible lifethreatening harms, including thrombosis, fatal stroke, major cardiovascular events, and death (PICO 1.6b, 1.10b, 1.12b, 1.16b, 1.17b, 1.21b, 1.22b, 1.23b, 1.24b, 1.25b, 1.28b, 2.9, 2.14, 2.18, 2.21).</ns0:p><ns0:p>Multiple studies have shown that 12 months of ROM followed by an anti-resorptive agent (BP or DEN) for 12 month prevents fractures in patients with postmenopausal OP when compared to antiresorptive agent only</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with low fracture risk, we strongly recommend against adding oral or IV BP, PTH/PTHrP, RAL, DEN, or ROM (PICO 1.4a-1.28a).</ns0:p><ns0:p>Adults &lt;40 years have low fracture risk and have significant capacity to rebuild BMD losses induced by chronic GC therapy. OP therapy should not be started in this low-risk group</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendations for special populations of patients beginning long-term GC therapy at very high risk for fracture (Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_5">2</ns0:ref>)</ns0:p><ns0:p>For adults ≥40 years at very high fracture risk due to treatment with one or more courses of high-dose GC therapy (mean dose prednisone equivalent ≥30 mg daily for ≥30 days) or cumulative GC dose ≥5 g over 1 year, we conditionally recommend treating with PTH/PTHrP over anti-resorptive agents regardless of FRAX score or BMD. We strongly recommend oral BP over no treatment and conditionally recommend an IV BP, DEN, RAL or ROM over no treatment.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The relative risk for vertebral fracture was 14 and for hip fractures was 3 with a dose of ≥30 mg per day and ≥ 5 g of cumulative use</ns0:p><ns0:p>For adults &lt;40 years receiving one or more courses of high-dose GC therapy (mean dose prednisone equivalent ≥30 mg daily for ≥30 days) or cumulative GC dose ≥5 g over 1 year, we conditionally recommend oral or IV BP, PTH/PTHrP, DEN. We conditionally recommended against RAL/ROM (PICO 6.4a,b-6.24a,b).</ns0:p><ns0:p>In this younger population, PTH/ PTHrP and ROM should only be used in adults with closed growth plates. DEN should be used with caution in patients with open growth plates.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For patients who can become pregnant at moderate or high risk of fracture, we conditionally recommend treating with oral or IV BP, DEN, or PTH/PTHrP (PICO 2).</ns0:p><ns0:p>OP therapy is not contraindicated in patients who can become pregnant but should be used with effective birth control if sexually active. BP are avidly taken up by the fetal skeleton as shown in animal models and have a long half-life of BP in adult bones with unclear side effects for the fetal skeleton</ns0:p><ns0:p>For adults with solid organ transplants and an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥35 mL/min who are continuing chronic GC treatment, we conditionally recommend treatment with BP, DEN, PTH/PTHrP, or RAL, based on individual patient factors over no treatment (PICO 5.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In this solid organ transplant population, we conditionally recommend against using ROM due to potential harms in this population (PICO 5.9, 5.21, 5.16).</ns0:p><ns0:p>This group of patients is typically considered at increased risk of fracture regardless of BMD, due to the known risk of OP associated with solid organ transplantation and anti-rejection medications. The overall certainty of evidence for treatment in this population is low, and numerous potentially influential individual patient factors need to be weighed when selecting treatment.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For adult renal transplant recipients on chronic GC treatment, we conditionally recommend metabolic bone disease expert evaluation for chronic kidney disease-mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD).</ns0:p><ns0:p>In patients with stage IV and V CKD, renal osteodystrophy, including adynamic bone disease, osteomalacia, osteitis fibrosa cystica, and mixed uremic osteodystrophy, is nearly universal</ns0:p><ns0:p>The panel recommended that patients without hyperparathyroidism and eGFR ≥30 mL/min could use vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) or vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) instead of biologically active forms of vitamin D (calcitriol, paricalticol, or doxercalciferol). Patients with GFR &lt;30 mL/min might require biologically active VitD to maintain neutral calcium balance.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For children and youth ages 4 to 17 years treated with GCs for &gt;3 months who are at low or moderate risk for fracture, optimization of age-appropriate dietary and supplemental calcium and vitamin D to fulfill the Recommended Daily Allowance is conditionally recommended in addition to an exercise program. We conditionally recommend against starting OP therapy due to the low risk of osteoporotic fractures in children and youth ages 4 to 17 years (PICO 7.1a-7.5a).</ns0:p><ns0:p>For children and youth ages 4 to 17 years with an osteoporotic fracture who are continuing treatment with chronic GC at a dose of ≥0.1 mg/kg/day for &gt;3 months, treating with an oral or IV BP is conditionally recommended over no treatment.  This conditional recommendation to treat with oral or IV BP to prevent recurrent fractures is based on low-certainty evidence. Depending on the specific disease or cause of pediatric OP, there is uncertainty about when and how to screen, and depending on the guidelines, it requires a history of clinically significant fracture(s), defined as ≥1 vertebral fractures, ≥2 long bone fractures prior to age 10 years, or ≥3 long bone fractures up to age 19 years</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Recommendations for initial treatment failure</ns0:head><ns0:p>For adults continuing GC treatment who have had an osteoporotic fracture ≥12 months after starting OP therapy, or who have had a significant loss of BMD (eg, greater than the least significant change per their DXA machine) after 1 to 2 years of OP treatment, we conditionally recommend changing to another class of OP medication over not switching the class of OP medication (PICO 10.1-10.9).</ns0:p><ns0:p>If oral BP is the first OP therapy and suboptimal adherence or poor absorption is suspected, based on low certainty evidence, we conditionally recommend treatment with IV BP, DEN, ROM, or PTH/PTHrP. Of note, use of PTH/PTHrP after long-term BP treatment has blunted anabolic response but still increases BMD. If DEN is the first agent, switching to PTH/PTHrP may lead to transient bone losses in the hip and spine and is not recommended<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendations for treatment when GC are discontinued (Figure<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ns0:ref>)</ns0:p><ns0:p>For adults taking OP therapy and discontinuing GC therapy, with no new fragility fracture and a current BMD t-score ≥-2.5, we strongly recommended stopping current OP therapy and continuing calcium and vitamin D. However, sequential therapy is strongly recommended after stopping DEN, PTH/PTHrP, and ROM (Figure<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">5</ns0:ref>) (PICO 11.1, 13.1-13.4).</ns0:p><ns0:p>This recommendation is based on low-certainty evidence and on the balance of benefits and harms of continued treatment with OP medication. BP and RAL can be discontinued without need for sequential therapy. DEN, PTH/PTHrP, and ROM should be transitioned to anti-resorptive therapy, but the best formulation and duration of treatment is unclear at this time</ns0:p><ns0:p>For adults ≥40 years discontinuing GC therapy and continuing to be at high risk of fracture (BMD t-score ≤-2.5, or history of a fragility fracture occurring after ≥12 months of therapy), we conditionally recommend continuing current OP therapy or switching to another class of OP medication (PICO 13.5-13.6).</ns0:p><ns0:p>For adults ≥40 years continuing chronic GC who discontinue DEN, we strongly recommend starting an antiresorptive over not starting OP medication (PICO 13.1, 13.3, 13.5).</ns0:p><ns0:p>DEN remains effective at longer than 10 years in patients with postmenopausal OP. However, discontinuation of DEN after two or more doses has been associated with rapid loss of BMD and development of new vertebral compression fractures as soon as 7 to 9 months after the last DEN dose. As such, 6 to 9 months after the last dose of DEN, BP or ROM therapy is recommended</ns0:p><ns0:p>For adults ≥40 years discontinuing chronic GC treatment who have completed a course of a PTH/PTHrP, we conditionally recommend starting BP over not starting an OP medication (PICO 13.4, 13.6).</ns0:p><ns0:p>Discontinuation of PTH/PTHrP medication may lead to gradual loss of bone gained over 12 to 18 months, which can be prevented by treatment with BP or DEN<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">4</ns0:ref>). Therefore, BP therapy is recommended after discontinuation of PTH/PTHrP.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>DISCUSSION</ns0:head><ns0:p>The objective of this updated ACR guideline for the prevention and treatment of GIOP (<ns0:ref type="formula">25</ns0:ref>) is to aid clinicians who prescribe GC, across all specialties, to best identify GC-treated patients who would benefit from prevention and treatment of GIOP. The overall goal is to reduce the number of fractures and their adverse consequences in this patient population, while minimizing harm due to medications. Fractures, especially hip and vertebral fractures, are associated with increased mortality, and patients frequently do not return to their baseline mobility</ns0:p><ns0:p>We risk stratified patients as low, moderate, high or very high risk of fracture based on FRAX 10-year probability and DXA t-or z-scores (Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_2">1</ns0:ref>). Similar to other organizational postmenopausal OP guidelines (AACE, SBEM, UK, and National Osteoporosis Foundation (NOF))<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">2,</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">3,</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">and5</ns0:ref>). These cut points were used to stratify PICO questions and weigh potential benefits versus harms of OP therapy. For prednisone-equivalent doses &gt;7.5 mg/day, a FRAX GC correction is recommended and is achieved by multiplying the risk of MOF by 1.15 and the risk of hip fractures by 1.2. Fracture risk is considered highest for patients treated with very high (≥30 mg/day) or large cumulative GC doses (≥5 g/year)</ns0:p><ns0:p>Risk assessment in children, youths, and adults &lt;40 years is not as clear because these populations have substantially lower fracture risk than older adults. BP treatment for children was recommended only after a diagnosis of pediatric OP, which requires a clinically significant history of vertebral or long bone fractures. For children with a GC-associated fracture who continue to take high-dose GC therapy (&gt;0.1 mg/kg/day), BP therapy is warranted.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For adults ≥40 years, the panel voted to give clinicians the ability to select an OP therapy based on the patient's specific comorbidities and preferences, BMD values, fracture history, and other characteristics, rather than rank ordering the medication recommendations. Fracture prevention data in GIOP is currently limited to oral BP and PTH. Anabolic agents may be the preferred initial therapy for those at very high risk for fracture based on BMD and vertebral fracture prevention superiority compared to anti-resorptives in patients with very high risk postmenopausal OP. Of note, abaloparatide and ROM are not approved in GIOP, and we recognize it may be difficult to access these medications for GIOP.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The panel specifically noted that the potential harms of RAL (venous thromboembolism [VTE] and fatal stroke) and ROM (major myocardial infarction, stroke, and death) would often favor the other available options when possible.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The panel emphasized the need for shared decision-making with patients to ensure they understand that some OP therapies (DEN, PTH/PTHrP, ROM) require another course of antiresorptive OP therapy to prevent rapid bone loss and vertebral fractures</ns0:p><ns0:p>The use of OP medications in patients after kidney transplant and with CKD was addressed in this guideline. When eGFR &lt;35 mL/min, the risk of renal osteodystrophy is significantly increased, including adynamic bone disease, osteomalacia, osteitis fibrosa cystica, and mixed uremic osteodystrophy. As such, MBD expert evaluation for CKD-MBD is conditionally recommended to exclude these conditions. Once excluded, no dose adjustment is needed when prescribing DEN, PTH/PTHrP, or ROM, but BP should be avoided. Use of DEN in this group may lead to prolonged and more severe hypocalcemia</ns0:p><ns0:p>A limitation of this guideline is the lack of fracture data in GIOP-specific clinical trials and population studies. As such, general OP population clinical trials data were reviewed when GIOP data were not available. This introduced indirectness into the certainty of the evidence and imprecision in the estimate of benefits for treatment in the GIOP population. Because of these limitations, most of the recommendations in this guideline are conditional.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Future studies in the treatment of GIOP should be powered to assess fracture risk reduction. Studies should focus on children and patients with CKD stage 4 and 5. As part of risk assessment, studies should explore the use of quantitative computed tomography (CT), bone finite element analysis from CT scans, and BMD measurements from CT colonography. It would be helpful to have validated fracture prediction scores for patients aged &lt;40 years. More studies are needed to better identify the patient populations that might benefit from combination therapy and sequential therapy in GIOP. Additional studies are required to determine the best treatment options and duration of therapy after discontinuation of DEN. In conclusion, GIOP remains a common and challenging clinical scenario that is frequently unrecognized and undertreated. By systematically synthesizing the current knowledge and available clinical trials, we have provided an updated guideline to help clinicians best care for patients requiring long-term GC use.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:note place="foot" xml:id="foot_0"><ns0:p>21514658, 2023, 12, Downloaded from https://acrjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25240, Wiley Online Library on [13/12/2023].
