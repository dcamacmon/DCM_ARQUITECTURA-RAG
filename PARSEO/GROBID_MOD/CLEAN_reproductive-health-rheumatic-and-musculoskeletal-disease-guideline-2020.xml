The ACR considers adherence to the recommendations within this guideline to be voluntary, with the ultimate determination regarding their application to be made by the clinician in light of each patient's individual circumstances. Guidelines and recommendations are intended to promote beneficial or desirable outcomes, but cannot guarantee any specific outcome. Guidelines and recommendations developed and endorsed by the ACR are subject to periodic revision, as warranted by the evolution of medical knowledge, technology, and practice. ACR recommendations are not intended to dictate payment or insurance decisions. These recommendations cannot adequately convey all uncertainties and nuances of patient care.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The American College of Rheumatology is an independent, professional, medical and scientific society that does not guarantee, warrant, or endorse any commercial product or service.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>INTRODUCTION</ns0:head><ns0:p>The management of reproductive health issues in patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases (RMD) differs from that in healthy persons. As a result, rheumatologists and other clinicians caring for these patients must often discuss with and counsel their patients about contraception, pregnancy and lactation (including medications), assisted reproductive technology (ART), fertility preservation, and hormone replacement therapy (HRT), and they must collaborate with specialists in the fields of obstetrics-gynecology, maternal-fetal medicine, and reproductive endocrinology and infertility.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Pregnancy in women with RMD may lead to serious maternal or fetal adverse outcomes; accordingly, contraception, tailored to the individual patient with emphasis on safety and efficacy, should be discussed and encouraged. Because risk for pregnancy complications depends on diagnosis, disease activity and damage, medications, and the presence of anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, and antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies, pre-pregnancy assessment is critical to informing pregnancy management, therapy, and outcomes. The ability to become pregnant may itself be an independent concern for some patients, so minimizing risk of gonadal insufficiency is important. RMD patients with subfertility value advice from their rheumatologists about oocyte preservation and in vitro fertilization (IVF).</ns0:p><ns0:p>It is difficult to avoid use of medication during pregnancy in patients with RMD. Not all medications are safe for preconception use by men and women or during pregnancy and lactation, but uncontrolled systemic inflammatory disease is itself associated with poor pregnancy outcomes</ns0:p><ns0:p>Given the primary goal of providing recommendations for care of all adult RMD patients throughout the reproductive lifespan, the scope of this guideline is broad. There has been little attention to aspects of reproductive health care other than pregnancy in patients with RMD, and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recognizes the imperative for guidance in reproductive health issues for these patients.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>RESULTS/RECOMMENDATIONS</ns0:head><ns0:p>The detailed tables of recommendations appear in Supplementary Appendix 7 (available on the Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology web site at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41191/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41191/ abstract</ns0:ref>).

Briefly, included within the positive aPL group are patients with asymptomatic aPL who have no history of thrombosis or pregnancy morbidity (i.e., meet laboratory but not clinical APS criteria), patients with obstetric APS (OB APS), and patients with thrombotic APS. OB APS refers to patients who meet laboratory criteria for APS and have experienced prior pregnancy complications consistent with APS (with other causes ruled out). These include 3 consecutive losses prior to 10 weeks' gestation, a fetal loss at or after 10 weeks' gestation, or delivery at &lt;34 weeks due to preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, or fetal distress. Thrombotic APS refers to patients who meet laboratory criteria for APS and have experienced a prior thrombotic event (arterial or venous), regardless of whether they have had obstetric complications. The aPL definitions in the guideline include both patients with and patients without other underlying autoimmune disease, unless specifically stated.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Patients with lower-titer aCL and/or anti-β 2 GPI (or noncriteria aPL) who do not meet laboratory classification criteria may still have some degree of risk that is difficult to quantify. Recommendations for these patients are not offered in this guideline; decisions regarding therapy rest on discussion between the patient and the physician, taking into account additional relevant risk factors. process, and Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ns0:ref>provides efficacy data and comments on available contraceptives. RMD patients typically underutilize effective contraception</ns0:p><ns0:p>Effectiveness of reversible forms of contraception varies. For long-acting reversible contraceptives (copper or progestin intrauterine devices</ns0:p><ns0:p>While long-acting reversible contraceptives are encouraged as first-line contraceptives for all appropriate candidates, including nulliparous women and adolescents<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41191/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41191/ abstract</ns0:ref>). "Hormonal contraceptives" refers to any contraception containing a hormone, including estrogen-progestin contraceptives and progestin-only contraceptives. The term "fertile women" refers to women of reproductive age who do not have documented menopause, hysterectomy, or permanent sterilization (i.e., women who may become pregnant).</ns0:p><ns0:p>In fertile women with RMD who have neither SLE nor positive aPL, we strongly recommend use of effective contraceptives (i.e., hormonal contraceptives or IUDs) over less effective options or no contraception; among effective methods, we conditionally recommend the highly effective IUDs or subdermal progestin implant (long-acting reversible contraceptives) because they have the lowest failure rates.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We strongly recommend discussing use of emergency contraception with all patients, including those with SLE or positive aPL, because risks of emergency contraception are low compared to those of unplanned pregnancy.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Levonorgestrel, the over-the-counter option, is widely available and has no medical contraindications to use, including thrombophilia</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>SLE patients.</ns0:head><ns0:p>Controlled studies of estrogen-progestin contraceptives in SLE have enrolled only women with stable, low disease activity; they specifically excluded those with high disease activity and history of thrombosis</ns0:p><ns0:p>In SLE patients with stable or low disease activity who are not positive for aPL, we strongly recommend use of effective contraceptives (i.e., hormonal contraceptives or IUDs) over less effective options or no contraception, and we conditionally recommend the highly effective IUDs or subdermal progestin implant because they have the lowest failure rates.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend against use of the transdermal estrogen-progestin patch in patients with SLE.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Although not directly studied in SLE patients, the transdermal estrogen-progestin patch results in greater estrogen exposure than do oral or transvaginal methods</ns0:p><ns0:p>We strongly recommend progestin-only or IUD contraceptives over combined estrogen-progestin contraception in SLE patients with moderate or severe disease activity, including nephritis, because estrogen-containing contraceptives have not been studied in SLE patients with moderate or severe disease activity.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Antiphospholipid antibody-positive patients. Presence of aPL, with or without history of clinical complications, is a contraindication to use of estrogen-containing contraceptives due the potential further increase in thrombosis risk.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We strongly recommend against combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives in women with positive aPL because estrogen increases risk of thromboembolism.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We strongly recommend IUDs (levonorgestrel or copper) or the progestin-only pill in women with positive aPL.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In aPL-positive patients, we do not recommend DMPA due to concern regarding thrombogenicity. We do not comment on the relatively new progestin implant due to lack of data.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in healthy women taking combined estrogen-progestin contraceptives is 36 times higher than the baseline annual risk of 1/10,000 women</ns0:p><ns0:p>The copper IUD is a highly effective alternative that does not increase risk of VTE, but it may increase menstrual bleeding and cramping for several months after insertion. Progestin IUDs may decrease these symptoms</ns0:p><ns0:p>We suggest the progestin-only pill (which is an effective, but not highly effective, contraceptive) as a low-risk alternative for patients who are unable or unwilling to use an IUD. The lack of data specific to aPL-positive patients using the progestin-only pill or IUD must be weighed against the risk of pregnancy-related VTE in the general population, which is &gt;10 times that seen with estrogen-progestin contraceptive use. Pregnancy-related thrombosis risk in aPL-positive patients is not well quantified, but VTE risk is 197/10,000 women-years for pregnant patients with a single prothrombotic mutation and 776/10,000 women-years</ns0:p><ns0:p>Other special RMD situations. Factors other than diagnosis of SLE or presence of aPL may influence the choice of contraception in women with RMD. These include use of medications and presence or risk of osteoporosis. Immunosuppressive therapy does not preclude use of any contraceptive method, but there is concern that mycophenolate-containing medications may interfere with hormonal contraceptive efficacy.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Since IUDs are the most effective contraceptive options, we strongly recommend the IUD (copper or progestin) for women with RMD who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy, despite hypothetical infection risk.</ns0:p><ns0:p>IUD-associated infection risk in RMD patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy has not been specifically studied, but studies in women with HIV show no increase</ns0:p><ns0:p>In women with RMD who are at increased risk for osteoporosis from glucocorticoid use or underlying disease, we conditionally recommend against using DMPA as a longterm contraceptive because data suggest that bone mineral density declines by up to 7.5% over 2 years of use in a healthy population</ns0:p><ns0:p>Although there are no published data suggesting increased fracture risk, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends caution regarding DMPA use in women with or at increased risk for osteoporosis</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend that women with RMD taking mycophenolate mofetil/mycophenolic acid (MMF) use an IUD alone or 2 other methods of contraception together, because MMF may reduce serum estrogen and progesterone levels (in turn reducing the efficacy of oral contraceptives).</ns0:p><ns0:p>The Mycophenolate Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program suggests use of an IUD alone (copper or progestin is not specified), or an estrogen-progestin contraceptive or the progestin implant together with a barrier contraceptive</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Assisted reproductive technology</ns0:head><ns0:p>As is the case with any underlying significant medical disease, women undertaking ovarian stimulation must be cleared medically by the appropriate specialist. Similarly, women with APS, thrombotic or otherwise, should be cleared medically by their rheumatologist. The rheumatologist should consult with the reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist regarding adjustments to the ovarian stimulation protocol in order to minimize the risk to the patient. Women with these underlying conditions who undergo fertility therapy should do so only in centers where the appropriate expertise is readily available.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We strongly recommend proceeding with ART if needed in women with uncomplicated RMD who are receiving pregnancy-compatible medications, whose disease is stable/quiescent, and who are negative for aPL.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Compared to the benefit of a successful pregnancy, the risk of ART for subfertile patients with RMD is low; nonetheless, Figure<ns0:ref type="figure">2</ns0:ref>. Recommendations for use of assisted reproductive technology (ART) in women with rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease (RMD). CYC = cyclophosphamide; aPL = antiphospholipid antibody (persistent moderate-to-high-titer anticardiolipin or anti-β 2 -glycoprotein I antibody or persistent positive lupus anticoagulant); APS = antiphospholipid syndrome (obstetric and/or thrombotic); obstetric APS (OB APS) = patients meeting laboratory criteria for APS and having prior consistent pregnancy complications (≥3 consecutive losses prior to 10 weeks' gestation, fetal loss at or after 10 weeks' gestation, or delivery at &lt;34 weeks due to preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, or fetal distress) and with no history of thrombosis; thrombotic APS = patients meeting laboratory criteria for APS and having a prior thrombotic event (arterial or venous), regardless of whether they have had obstetric complications; LMWH = low molecular weight heparin; UH = unfractionated heparin.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Moderate or Severe Disease Activity</ns0:head><ns0:p>Defer ART</ns0:p><ns0:p>Assess aPL/APS status NOTE: Avoid prophylactic use of prednisone unless required to control active disease</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>SLE patients.</ns0:head><ns0:p>Data on IVF cycles in RMD patients are limited; however, the intended outcome of IVF, pregnancy, may be adversely affected by the presence of active RMD. In addition, there is concern that flare in SLE patients might be worsened in the setting of elevated estrogen levels.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We strongly recommend deferring ART procedures in patients with any RMD while disease is moderately or severely active; this recommendation is based on extrapolated evidence that RMD disease activity increases pregnancy risks.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For pregnancy planning, 6 months of stable inactive or lowlevel disease is most often suggested, but individual clinical factors may influence this decision. In patients with SLE, there is theoretical concern that ovarian stimulation with elevated estrogen levels may worsen active disease.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend against an empiric dosage increase of prednisone during ART procedures in patients with SLE; instead, we suggest monitoring the patient carefully and treating for flare if it occurs.</ns0:p><ns0:p>No studies have evaluated prescription of prophylactic prednisone to prevent SLE flare during ART.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Antiphospholipid antibody-positive patients. Patients who are positive for aPL are at increased risk for thrombosis. Most reports of aPL-positive patients undergoing IVF describe the use of empiric prophylactic anticoagulation due to concern regarding further increased risk of potentially life-threatening thrombosis from elevated estrogen levels during ovarian stimulation.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In subfertile patients with RMD who desire pregnancy, have stable/quiescent disease, and have asymptomatic positive aPL, OB APS, or treated thrombotic APS, we conditionally recommend ART with anticoagulation, as described below.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend prophylactic anticoagulation therapy with heparin or low molecular weight heparin in asymptomatic aPL-positive patients during ART procedures</ns0:p><ns0:p>The increased risk of organ-or life-threatening thrombosis due to high estrogen levels greatly outweighs the low risk of bleeding or other complications of unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).</ns0:p><ns0:p>We strongly recommend prophylactic anticoagulation with heparin or LMWH in women with OB APS, and we strongly recommend therapeutic anticoagulation in women with thrombotic APS, during ART procedures.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The strength of these recommendations rests on the severity of the risk of organ-or life-threatening thrombosis during ovarian stimulation. An added risk for thrombosis is ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, an important, uncommon complication consisting of capillary leak syndrome (with pleural effusion and ascites) and, in severe cases, arterial and venous thrombosis and renal failure</ns0:p><ns0:p>LMWH is used most commonly. Prophylactic dosing of enoxaparin is usually 40 mg daily, started at the beginning of ovarian stimulation, withheld 24-36 hours prior to oocyte retrieval, and resumed following retrieval. Optimal duration of prophylactic LMWH for asymptomatic aPL-positive patients undergoing ovarian stimulation has not been studied; this is a decision best made in consultation with the reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist. The treatment is often continued until estrogen levels return to near-physiologic levels if no pregnancy occurs. Patients with OB APS will continue therapy throughout pregnancy. Aspirin is not commonly used prior to oocyte retrieval (it will be started after retrieval if indicated) given concern that its prolonged action may increase bleeding risk at the time of the retrieval. Patients receiving regular anticoagulation therapy with vitamin K antagonists for thrombotic APS should transition to therapeutic-dose LMWH for ART (usually enoxaparin 1 mg/kg subcutaneously every 12 hours), with this treatment withheld for retrieval and resumed subsequently, to continue throughout pregnancy. Since ovarian stimulation protocols vary, discussion with the reproductive endocrinology and infertility specialist is appropriate. In addition to anticoagulation, patients at risk for thrombosis or ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome may benefit from ovarian stimulation protocols that yield lower peak serum estrogen levels, such as those incorporating aromatase inhibitors</ns0:p><ns0:p>Embryo and oocyte cryopreservation. Embryo and oocyte cryopreservation are good options to preserve fertility in patients whose condition is stable enough for them to undergo ovarian stimulation but who are either not able or not ready to pursue pregnancy at the time of stimulation. A carefully monitored ovarian stimulation/IVF cycle followed by embryo transfer to a surrogate is an option, if available, for patients with severe disease-related damage who desire a biologic child and are able to undergo ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval, but cannot safely undergo pregnancy.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We strongly recommend continuation of necessary immunosuppressive and/or biologic therapies (except CYC, which directly impacts maturing follicles) in treated patients whose condition is stable, when the purpose of ovarian stimulation is oocyte retrieval for oocyte or embryo cryopreservation.</ns0:p><ns0:p>This includes continuation of mycophenolate or methotrexate (MTX). There is an anticipated risk of uncontrolled disease from withdrawal of effective medication. However, there are no published data that directly address oocyte retrieval during treatment with most immunosuppressive or biologic therapies other than CYC. Fertility preservation in women with RMD treated with CYC. Although CYC is used less frequently than in the past due to availability of alternative treatments, it remains a mainstay of therapy for severe or life-threatening RMD. Ovarian insufficiency is a potential long-term complication of monthly intravenous CYC therapy. Hormonal co-therapy during the course of CYC is suggested to reduce risk of ovarian insufficiency.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Fertility preservation with cyclophosphamide</ns0:head><ns0:p>To prevent inducing primary ovarian insufficiency in premenopausal women with RMD receiving monthly intravenous CYC, we conditionally recommend monthly gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist co-therapy.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Ovarian insufficiency risk with CYC treatment depends on patient age and cumulative monthly CYC dose</ns0:p><ns0:p>Thus far, studies have addressed gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist co-therapy only in CYC-treated RMD patients who receive CYC monthly by intravenous administration. Acknowledging this lack of data on oral CYC-treated patients, it is reasonable to consider gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist use for these patients. Theoretically, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist co-therapy may not be necessary for patients receiving the lower cumulative CYC dose in the Euro-Lupus regimen</ns0:p><ns0:p>Fertility preservation in men with RMD treated with CYC. CYC may cause infertility and long-term gonadal damage in treated men. Options for fertility preservation should be presented to male patients in whom CYC therapy is required.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend against testosterone co-therapy in men with RMD receiving CYC, as it does not preserve fertility in men undergoing chemotherapy for malignancy</ns0:p><ns0:p>Because sperm cryopreservation prior to treatment preserves a man's ability to conceive a healthy child, we strongly suggest sperm cryopreservation as good practice for CYC-treated men who desire it.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We acknowledge the difficulty of coordinating sperm banking when CYC therapy is urgently indicated.

An understanding of basic pregnancy physiology is helpful for rheumatologists to identify and treat active disease during pregnancy and coordinate care with obstetric providers.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Pregnancy changes may impact manifestations of RMD. Pregnancy-related increased intravascular volume may worsen already abnormal cardiac or renal function. The expected 50% increase in glomerular filtration rate during pregnancy may worsen preexisting stable proteinuria. Pregnancy-induced hypercoagulability increases RMD-associated thrombosis risk. The calcium demand of fetal bone development and breastfeeding may worsen maternal osteoporosis. In addition, normal pregnancy symptoms such as malar erythema, chloasma gravidarum, anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation, and diffuse arthralgias may falsely mimic symptoms of active RMD. Pregnancy-induced hypertension syndromes (preeclampsia) may be confused with lupus nephritis, scleroderma renal crisis, or vasculitis flare. HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets) or eclampsia may resemble severe disease flare. Distinguishing among these syndromes requires the expertise of rheumatologists and obstetrics-gynecology or maternal-fetal medicine physicians working together.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Most information regarding pregnancy management in RMD comes from observational studies, primarily in patients with SLE and APS. There have been very few controlled trials. Data about pregnancies in rare rheumatic diseases usually derive from small case series. For these reasons, many recommendations are conditional, supported by collective experience of the Voting Panel members and patient input. Supplementary Appendix As standard good practice, we strongly suggest counseling women with RMD who are considering pregnancy regarding the improved maternal and fetal outcomes (based on many studies) associated with entering pregnancy with quiescent/low activity disease</ns0:p><ns0:p>Patient participants expressed a strong desire that their physicians discuss family planning "early and often," including before planning of pregnancy. Discussion with patients should include information on medications and impact of disease activity, autoantibodies, and organ system abnormalities on maternal and fetal health. In rare situations with significant disease-related damage, such as pulmonary arterial hypertension, renal dysfunction, heart failure, or other severe organ damage, pregnancy may be contraindicated due to high risk of maternal morbidity and mortality.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In women with RMD planning pregnancy who are receiving medication that is incompatible with pregnancy, we strongly recommend switching to a pregnancycompatible medication and observing for sufficient time to assess efficacy and tolerability of the new medication.</ns0:p><ns0:p>There are no data to support a specific period of time for observation with pregnancy-compatible medications. Timing will vary depending on individual clinical factors; in clinical practice this is usually a minimum of several months.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In women with RMD who are currently pregnant and have active disease that requires medical therapy, we strongly recommend initiating or continuing a pregnancycompatible steroid-sparing medication, as both active RMD and continuous high-dose glucocorticoid treatment have potential for maternal and fetal harm</ns0:p><ns0:p>Pre-pregnancy or early pregnancy laboratory testing for relevant autoantibodies is recommended. Ascertaining anti-Ro/SSA, anti-La/SSB, and aPL status improves counseling regarding pregnancy and fetal risk.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We strongly recommend testing for anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB once before or early in pregnancy in women with SLE or SLE-like disorders, Sjögren's syndrome, systemic sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Given the relative persistence and unchanged titers of these antibodies, we strongly recommend against repeating the test during pregnancy.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Patients with scleroderma renal crisis. Most diseasespecific recommendations for RMD pregnancy management focus on presence of underlying SLE or positive aPL. One aspect of disease in systemic sclerosis, however, is of particular importance during pregnancy: the development of scleroderma renal crisis. While effective medications are usually contraindicated during pregnancy due to risk of adverse fetal effects, they should be considered in this unusual and life-threatening circumstance.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We strongly recommend use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blockade therapy to treat active scleroderma renal crisis in pregnancy, because the risk of maternal or fetal death with untreated disease is higher than the risk associated with use of these medications during pregnancy.</ns0:p><ns0:p>While scleroderma renal crisis is rare in pregnancy (an estimated 2% of scleroderma pregnancies), it can easily be confused Recommendations and good practice statements (GPS) for pregnancy counseling, assessment, and management in women with rheumatic and musculoskeletal disease (RMD).

Issues regarding contraception, fertility, pregnancy, lactation, and the offspring's health affect almost every patient across all RMD diagnoses. The importance of this area is highlighted by recent publications that have addressed key elements of reproductive health for some or all RMD patients. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) published recommendations regarding women's health issues in patients with SLE and APS</ns0:p><ns0:p>Even with the wide spectrum of reproductive issues addressed here (Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_15">4</ns0:ref>), this project has important limitations. This guideline was developed, and the literature review conducted, in the adult population. An important future step will be to consider these issues among adolescents, as counseling and care for these patients may differ.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Another important limitation is the inability to include recommendations for uncommon but important clinical situations. Although our mandate was broad, our task was to derive and support our recommendations with available evidence, but many uncommon clinical scenarios have little published data. One such situation that reflects an ongoing research need is the challenge of reproductive health issues specific to transgender individuals, especially regarding hormonal therapies.</ns0:p><ns0:p>A relatively rare but important scenario is the therapeutic termination of pregnancy in patients with life-threatening disease damage or flare. Pregnancy in patients with preexisting severe organ damage carries profound maternal risk. Pulmonary arterial hypertension is associated with a particularly high risk of maternal mortality, estimated at up to 20% even with aggressive therapy</ns0:p><ns0:p>We provide data-derived recommendations for common clinical reproductive health decisions including recent advances in this area and emphasize the need for early involvement of the rheumatologist in reproductive health discussions involving patients with RMD, for instance, the importance of effective contraception. Almost half of pregnancies in the US are unplanned</ns0:p><ns0:p>Asking a patient about desire for pregnancy early and periodically (not only during perceived periods of change) and acknowledging her personal risk factors will ensure open dialog. New information supports a shift from the paradigm of discon tinuing all RMD medications except prednisone, since pregnancy-compatible steroid-sparing disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs and biologic agents pose fewer short-and long-term risks to mother and infant. With adequate planning, treatment, and monitoring, most women with RMD can have successful pregnancies. Recent data indicate compatibility of many rheumatology medications both with lactation and with paternal use. The rheumatologist's familiarity with drug safety during these periods is important to maintain disease control and minimize mother and infant risk.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Fertility and postmenopausal issues are not uncommon in RMD patients. Recommendations regarding ART reflect a growing demand among patients with RMD for fertility therapies. Oocyte freezing is now widely available</ns0:p><ns0:p>The strength of evidence on reproductive health topics in RMD patients is moderate at best, and usually low, very low, or nonexistent for many topics of interest. Identification of areas with weak evidence highlights research priorities. One need is to establish the long-term safety profile of highly effective contraceptives in RMD patients with and without aPL. Although low-dose aspirin for preeclampsia prophylaxis in SLE and aPL patients is a low-risk intervention, its effectiveness is not known. Management of OB APS is one area with moderately strong evidence, but treatment for women with recurring adverse outcomes despite standard therapy is needed. Much in the field of prevention, screening, and management of NLE requires further study. There are very limited data on RMD medication effects on fertility and teratogenicity in men with RMD. Because women with RMD who plan to conceive, are pregnant, or are lactating are usually excluded from clinical trials, large-scale data about medication use in these populations are also lacking. Pregnancy registries collect these data but suffer reporting bias and may not reflect the racial and ethnic make-up of the patient population. Given the difficulties of collecting clinical data, research that focuses on better understanding of placental and breast physiology, as well as drug and antibody transport, may help inform decision-making.</ns0:p><ns0:p>With the development of this guideline, the ACR recognizes the key role of clinical rheumatologists not only in managing disease activity but also in understanding the interactions of RMDs and their therapies in the context of reproductive health. The most important goal of this guideline is to provide substance and direction for discussion between clinicians and patients. A second goal is to encourage development of close working relationships among rheumatologists, specialists in obstetricsgynecology, maternal-fetal medicine, and reproductive endocrinology and infertility, and other involved clinicians. We present this guideline as a resource to share, discuss, and disseminate across specialties and patient groups.</ns0:p></ns0:div></ns0:body><ns0:back>
