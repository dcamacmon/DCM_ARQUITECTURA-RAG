		<ns0:body><ns0:div><ns0:head>INTRODUCTION</ns0:head><ns0:p>Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory musculoskeletal disease associated with psoriasis, manifesting most commonly with peripheral arthritis, dactylitis, enthesitis, and spondylitis. Nail lesions, including pitting and onycholysis, occur in ~80-90% of patients with PsA. The incidence of PsA is ~6 per 100,000 per year, and the prevalence is ~1-2 per 1,000 in the general population</ns0:p><ns0:p>PsA affects men and women equally. The distribution of the peripheral arthritis varies from asymmetric oligoarthritis (involving ≤4 joints) to symmetric polyarthritis (involving ≥5 joints). Distal interphalangeal joints are commonly affected and, in some patients, are the only affected joints. Axial disease, when present, usually occurs together with peripheral arthritis. Some patients present with rapidly progressive and destructive PsA-arthritis mutilans. PsA is associated with an adverse impact on healthrelated quality of life</ns0:p><ns0:p>Both nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic treatment can ameliorate PsA symptoms and can occasionally result in disease remission (Figure<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ns0:ref>). Clinicians and patients can now choose from a wide variety of pharmacologic therapies, including symptomatic treatments such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and intraarticular injections, as well as immunomodulatory therapies.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The presentation of PsA is heterogeneous, and health care providers frequently face challenges when considering the various treatment options. Our objective was to develop evidence-based treatment recommendations for the management of active PsA in adults, using pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapies. These PsA treatment recommendations can help guide both clinicians and patients to arrive at optimal management decisions.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>METHODS</ns0:head><ns0:p>Methodology overview. This guideline followed the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline development process (<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://www.rheumatology.org/Practice-Quality/Clinical-Support/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines">http://www.rheumatology.org/Practice-Quality/ Clinical-Support/Clinical-Practice-Guidelines</ns0:ref>). This process inclu des using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) methodology  (www. gradeworkinggroup.org) to rate the quality of the available evidence and to develop the recommendations. ACR policy guided disclosures and the management of conflicts of interest. The full methods are presented in detail in Supplementary Appendix 1, on the Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology web site at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40726/abstract">http://onlinelibrary. wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40726/abstract</ns0:ref>. This work involved 4 teams selected by the ACR Quality of Care Committee after reviewing individual and group volunteer applications in response to an open request for proposals announcement: 1) a Core Leadership Team, which supervised and coordinated the project and drafted the clinical questions and manuscript; 2) a Literature Review Team, which completed the literature search and abstraction; 3) an Expert Panel, composed of patients, patient advocates, rheumatologists, dermatologists, 1 dermatologist-rheumatologist, and 1 rheumatology nurse practitioner, which developed the clinical questions (PICO [population/intervention/comparator/outcomes] questions) and decided on the scope of the guideline project; and 4) a Voting Panel, which included rheumatologists, 1 dermatologist, 1 dermatologist-rheumatologist, 1 rheumatology physician assistant, and 2 patients (1 of whom was also a physical therapist), who provided input from the patient perspective and voted on the recommendations. Additionally, a Patient Panel consisting of 9 adults with PsA reviewed the evidence and provided input on their values and preferences, which was reviewed before discussion of each section of PsA management (e.g., treatment-naive, treated, comorbidities), and was incorporated into discussions and formulation of recommendations. Supplementary Appendix 2 (<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40726/abstract">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40726/abstract</ns0:ref>) presents rosters of the team and panel members. In accor dance with ACR policy, the principal investigator and the leader of the literature review team were free of conflicts, and within each team, &gt;50% of the members were free of conflicts. Framework for the PsA guideline development and scope of the guideline. Because there are numerous topics within PsA that could be addressed, at the beginning of the process the guideline panels made several decisions regarding the focus of this guideline and how to define aspects of the disease (e.g., active disease). At an initial scoping meeting, the Voting Panel and Expert Panel agreed that the project would include the management of patients with active PsA, defined as symptoms at an unacceptably bothersome level as reported by the patient and judged by the examining health care provider to be due to PsA based on the presence of at least 1 of the following: actively inflamed joints, dactylitis, enthesitis, axial disease, active skin and/or nail involvement, and/or extraarticular manifestations such as uveitis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The health care provider may, in deciding if symptoms are due to active PsA, consider information beyond the core information from the history and physical examination, such as inflammation markers (C-reactive protein</ns0:p><ns0:p>In addressing pharmacologic therapies, we focused on immunomodulatory agents for long-term management rather than addressing acute symptom management (i.e., through intraarticular injections and the use of systemic glucocorticoids). Tofacitinib and ixekizumab were submitted for review and potential approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) at the time of formulation of this guideline</ns0:p><ns0:p>There are currently no widely agreed-upon definitions of disease severity in PsA or psoriasis. Thus, health care providers and patients should judge PsA and psoriasis severity on a case-bycase basis. For the purpose of these recommendations, severity includes not only the level of disease activity at a given time point, but also the presence or absence of poor prognostic factors and long-term damage. Examples of severe PsA disease include the presence of 1 or more of the following: a poor prognostic factor (erosive disease, dactylitis, elevated levels of inflammation mark-ers such as ESR and CRP attributable to PsA), long-term damage that interferes with function (e.g., joint deformities), highly active disease that causes a major impairment in quality of life (i.e., active psoriatic inflammatory disease at many sites [including dactylitis, enthesitis] or function-limiting inflammatory disease at few sites), and rapidly progressive disease (Figure<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ns0:ref>). In clinical trials, severe psoriasis has been defined as a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI)  score of ≥12 and a body surface area score of ≥10. However, because it is cumbersome, physicians seldom use the PASI in clinical practice. Examples of definitions of severe PsA and severe psoriasis are shown in Figure<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ns0:ref>. Finally, because the National Psoriasis Foundation (NPF) and American Academy of Dermatology are concurrently developing psoriasis treatment guidelines, the treatment of skin psoriasis separately from the inflammatory arthritis was not included in the current ACR/NPF PsA guideline.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The panels chose the critical outcomes for all comparisons at the initial scoping; these included the American College of Rheumatology 20% response criteria (ACR20) (the primary outcome for most PsA clinical trials), the Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index (a measure of physical function), the PASI 75% response criteria (PASI75) (a measure of skin psoriasis improvement), and serious infections. Both the ACR20 and the PASI75 are accepted outcome mea sures specified by regulatory agencies, including the US FDA, for the approval of treatments for PsA</ns0:p><ns0:p>Moving from evidence to recommendations. GRADE methodology specifies that panels make recommendations based on the balance of benefits and harms, the quality of the evidence (i.e., confidence in effect estimates), and patients' values and preferences. Deciding on the balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes requires estimating the relative value patients place on those outcomes. When the literature provided very limited guidance, the experience of the Voting Panel members (including physicians, a rheumatology physician assistant, and the 2 patients present) in managing the relevant cases and issues became an important source of evidence. Values and preferences, crucial to all recommendations, derived from input from the members of the Patient Panel were particularly salient in such situations. GRADE methodology allows the panels the possibility of not coming to a decision, and a summary of the discussion is noted in such cases. However, during the development of this guideline, the Voting Panel came to a conclusion in each case scenario, and such a situation did not arise.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Consensus building.</ns0:head><ns0:p>The Voting Panel voted on the direction and strength of the recommendation related to each PICO question. Recommendations required a 70% level of agreement, as used previously in other similar processes</ns0:p><ns0:p>Moving from recommendations to practice. These recommendations are designed to help health care providers work with patients in selecting therapies. The presence or absence of concomitantly occurring conditions, such as IBD, uveitis, diabetes, and serious infections, and the knowledge of previous therapies, influence decisions regarding optimal management. In the context of PsA, the physical examination, which is also required for selecting therapy, includes assessment of the peripheral joints (including for dactylitis), the entheses, the spine, the skin, and the nails. Health care providers and patients must take into consideration all active disease domains, comorbidities, and the patient's functional status in choosing the optimal therapy for an individual at a given point in time. Examples of "severe" psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and psoriasis. The guideline development group defined severe PsA and psoriasis as the presence of 1 or more of the items listed. This is not a formal definition. There have been many definitions of severe psoriasis used over time-the items here are adapted from the 2007 National Psoriasis Foundation expert consensus statement for moderate-to-severe psoriasis</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>RESULTS/RECOMMENDATIONS</ns0:head><ns0:p>How to interpret the recommendations 1. A strong recommendation means that the panel was confident that the desirable effects of following the recommendation outweigh the undesirable effects (or vice versa), so the course of action would apply to all or almost all patients, and only a small proportion of clinicians/patients not wanting to follow the recommendation. We use the phrase "should use" or "should be used" for strong recommendations. 2. A conditional recommendation means that the panel believed the desirable effects of following the recommendation probably outweigh the undesirable effects, so the course of action would apply to the majority of the patients, but a small proportion of clinicians/patients may not want to follow the recommendation. Because of this, conditional recommendations are preference sensitive and always warrant a shared decision-making approach. We use the phrase "is recommended over" or "is/would be recommended" for conditional recommendations. We specify conditions under which the less preferred drug may be used by using the phrase "may be used" or "may consider" or "Y (less preferred drug) may be used instead of X (preferred drug)" or "may consider Y instead of X (preferred drug)" for conditional recommendations.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head n="3.">Conditional recommendations were usually based on low-to</ns0:head><ns0:p>very-low-quality evidence (in rare instances, moderate-quality evidence). Strong recommendations were typically based on moderate-or high-quality evidence. 4. For each recommendation, Supplementary Appendix 5 (on the Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology web site at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40726/abstract">http://onlinelibrary. wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40726/abstract</ns0:ref>) provides details regarding the PICO questions and the GRADE evidence tables. 5. In each case, the Voting Panel's recommendation was based on a judgment of the most likely net benefit, i.e.,1) more benefit with the medication conditionally recommended with no difference in harms between the medications being compared (e.g., choosing a TNFi over OSMs in treatment-naive patients) or 2) less harm with the medication conditionally recommended and no difference in benefit (e.g., choosing abatacept over a TNFi in patients at risk of or with a history of previous infections, or preferring a different OSM over MTX in patients with PsA and diabetes due to an increased risk of liver toxicity in this subpopulation). 6. This is an evidence-based guideline, in that we explicitly use the best evidence available and present that in a transparent manner for the clinician reader/user</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Recommendations for pharmacologic interventions</ns0:head><ns0:p>Active PsA in treatment-naive patients (Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ns0:ref>and Figure<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ns0:ref>).

An IL-17i or IL-12/23i biologic may be used instead of TNFi biologics in patients with severe psoriasis or contraindications to TNFi biologics, and may be used instead of OSMs in patients with severe psoriasis or severe PsA. MTX is recommended over NSAIDs in treatmentnaive patients with active PsA. NSAIDs may be used instead of MTX after consideration of possible contraindications and side effect profile in patients without evidence of severe PsA or severe psoriasis and in those at risk for liver toxicity (Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ns0:ref>and Figure<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ns0:ref>).

For the purposes of these recommendations, severity is considered a broader concept than disease activity in that it encompasses the level of disease activity at a given time point, as well as the presence of poor prognostic factors and long-term damage. Examples of severe PsA disease include the presence of ≥1 of the following: a poor prognostic factor (erosive disease, elevated levels of inflammation markers such as C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate attributable to PsA), long-term damage that interferes with function (e.g., joint deformities, vision loss), highly active disease that causes major impairment in quality of life (i.e., active psoriatic inflammatory disease at many sites [including dactylitis, enthesitis] or function-limiting inflammatory disease at few sites), and rapidly progressive disease. § Because there are currently no widely agreed-upon definitions of disease severity, psoriasis severity should be established by the health care provider and patient on a case-by-case basis. In clinical trials, severe psoriasis has been defined as a Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score</ns0:p><ns0:p>ent OSM may be used rather than a TNFi in the presence of contraindications to TNFi biologics. A TNFi biologic is recommended over an IL-17i biologic, an IL-12/23i biologic, abatacept, or tofacitinib. An IL-17i biologic is recommended over an IL-12/23i biologic, abatacept, or tofacitinib. An IL-12/23i is recommended over abatacept or tofacitinib. In patients with contraindications to TNFi agents, an IL-12/23i, an IL-17i, abatacept, or tofacitinib may be used instead of a TNFi. In patients with severe psoriasis, an IL-12/23i or an IL-17i may be used instead of a TNFi. Tofacitinib may be used instead of a TNFi in patients preferring oral medication who do not have severe psoriasis.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Switching to another OSM is recommended over adding another OSM to the current treatment (except in the case of apremilast). Adding another OSM (except apremilast) to current treatment may be considered if the patient has exhibited partial response to the current OSM. Adding apremilast to the current OSM therapy is recommended over switching to apremilast monotherapy since most evidence for benefits of apremilast pertains to apremilast combination therapy. Switching to apremilast monotherapy may be considered instead of apremilast combination therapy if the patient has intolerable side effects with the current OSM.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Biologic monotherapy is recommended over biologic combination therapy with MTX (the most commonly used OSM in combination therapy).

Oral small molecules (OSMs) are defined as methotrexate (MTX), sulfasalazine, leflunomide, cyclosporine, or apremilast and do not include tofacitinib, which was handled separately since its efficacy/safety profile is much different from that of other OSMs listed above.

For the purposes of these recommendations, severity is considered a broader concept than disease activity in that it encompasses the level of disease activity at a given time point, as well as the presence of poor prognostic factors and long-term damage. Examples of severe PsA disease include the presence of ≥1 of the following: a poor prognostic factor (erosive disease, elevated levels of inflammation markers such as C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate attributable to PsA), long-term damage that interferes with function (e.g., joint deformities, vision loss), highly active disease that causes major impairment in quality of life (i.e., active psoriatic inflammatory disease at many sites [including dactylitis, enthesitis] or function-limiting inflammatory disease at few sites), and rapidly progressive disease. ¶ Because there are currently no widely agreed-upon definitions of disease severity, psoriasis severity should be established by the health care provider and patient on a case-by-case basis.

The goal of this guideline is to assist health care providers in managing active PsA in their patients, including optimizing therapy. PsA is a heterogene-ous and multifaceted inflammatory disease, and its different clinical features (e.g., peripheral arthritis, psoriasis, nail disease, enthesitis, dactylitis, axial disease) sometimes respond differently to therapy. Despite an expansion in the number of new therapies for PsA, there remains limited comparative efficacy/effectiveness evidence to inform treatment decisions. Thus, most of our recommendations are based on low-quality evidence and are conditional. The conditional recommendations convey that, although the suggested course of action will be best for many patients, there will be some patients in whom, considering their comorbidities and/or their values and preferences, the alternative represents the best choice. The guideline will be updated as new evidence from comparative studies becomes available.</ns0:p><ns0:p>A Patient Panel meeting was held prior to the Voting Panel meeting to gain insight into patients' values and preferences for the pharmacologic/nonpharmacologic intervention comparisons being addressed. We recognize that patient preferences are an important part of our treatment recommendations. Findings from the Patient Panel meeting were discussed throughout the Voting Panel provider and patient on a case-by-case basis. For the purposes of these recommendations, severity is considered a broader concept than disease activity in that it encompasses the level of disease activity at a given time point, as well as the presence of poor prognostic factors and long-term damage. Examples of severe PsA disease include the presence of ≥1 of the following: a poor prognostic factor (erosive disease, elevated levels of inflammation markers such as C-reactive protein or erythrocyte sedimentation rate attributable to PsA), long-term damage that interferes with function (e.g., joint deformities, vision loss), highly active disease that causes major impairment in quality of life (i.e., active psoriatic inflammatory disease at many sites [including dactylitis, enthesitis] or function-limiting inflammatory disease at few sites), and rapidly progressive disease. ¶ Because there are currently no widely agreed-upon definitions of disease severity, psoriasis severity should be established by the health care provider and patient on a case-by-case basis.

Examples of patient feedback included strong value on therapies that are effective (e.g., prevent further damage, and improve quality of life, social participation, and function) and safe (especially having low adverse event profiles). In particular, patients discussed the negative impact of adverse events (e.g., fatigue, nausea, and malaise) on quality of life and social participation, and thus the risk for these adverse events weighed heavily in patients' decision-making. The concept of treat-to-target was challenging for patients. Although they saw value in improved outcomes, they also thought this strategy could increase costs to the patient (e.g., copayments, time traveling to more frequent appointments, etc.) and potentially increase adverse events. Therefore, a detailed con-versation with the patient is needed to make decisions regarding treat-to-target. To help ensure that the recommendations were patient-centered, 2 patients were members of the Voting Panel. While using a treat-to-target approach over not using a treat-to-target approach was discussed by the Voting Panel, we did not address specific targets to be recommended or used. There have been 2 international meetings to discuss potential targets: the use of either disease activity (MDA) or disease activity in psoriatic arthritis (DAPSA)</ns0:p><ns0:p>The ACR/NPF PsA guideline conditionally recommends a TNFi biologic over an OSM agent in patients with active PsA.

In making their recommendation, the panel recognized the cost implications, but put considerations of quality of evidence for benefit over other considerations. This guideline provides recommendations for early and aggressive therapy in patients with newly diagnosed PsA. The recommendation is, however, conditional, and the panel recognized several potential exceptions to it. Circumstances in which a patient may choose an OSM over a TNFi biologic may include mild-to-moderate disease, a preference of oral over parenteral therapy, or concerns regarding adverse effects of a biologic. A TNFi biologic would not be a good choice in patients with contraindications, including congestive heart failure, previous serious infections, recurrent infections, or demyelinating disease.</ns0:p><ns0:p>During the development of the Group for Research and Assessment of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis recommendations</ns0:p><ns0:p>In patients with concomitant IBD, the Voting Panel made strong recommendations favoring a monoclonal antibody TNFi or an IL-12/23i biologic over an IL-17i biologic or a TNFi receptor biologic (etanercept).

Often, low-or very-low-quality evidence came from indirect evidence, for instance from rheumatoid arthritis<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40726/abstract">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40726/ abstract</ns0:ref>). When data on comparative benefits and comparative harms were similar between two medications, the panel explicitly preferred and recommended the medication for which longerterm harms were more well-known, and in which the physician experience in patients with PsA was longer, supplementing with harms data/experience from related rheumatic conditions, where these medications are commonly used. In each case, judgments of net benefit involved explicit consideration of values and preferences, including input from Patient Panel members of the Voting Panel as well as the full Patient Panel that met prior to the Voting Panel meeting.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We recognize that these recommendations do not account for the full complexity of PsA or the full range of possible therapies (e.g., glucocorticoids were not addressed). The high degree of heterogeneity in the presentation and course of PsA coupled with the involvement of multiple domains in a single patient cannot be captured in a single algorithm. In addition, reporting of disease measures and differences in inclusion/exclusion criteria in PsA clinical trials makes it difficult to compare therapies across trials. The impact of alternative therapies on important outcomes such as joint damage still remains to be elucidated. Vaccination recommendations with tofacitinib were not included, as it was not yet approved for PsA when the PICO questions were drafted and only a limited number of PICO questions could be feasibly included for voting. Additional topics, including vaccination in the setting of tofacitinib, will be addressed in a subsequent guideline update.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The ACR has decided to use GRADE methodology in the development of guidelines for the management of rheumatic diseases. The GRADE methodology specifies that panels make recommendations based on a consideration of the balance of relative benefits and harms of the treatment options under consideration, the quality of the evidence (i.e., confidence in the evidence based on the lowest quality of the critical outcomeshigh, moderate, low, or very low), and patients' values and preferences. The rating of the quality of evidence for each clinical situation (PICO question) helped to inform the strength of the recommendation (strong or conditional)</ns0:p><ns0:p>The use of GRADE (not used in other PsA treatment recommendations) allowed an explicit consideration of the overall evidence, including the balance of benefits and harms of treatments, the incorporation of patient values and preferences, and cost considerations to judge the tradeoff. This approach led to transparency in decision making by the Voting Panel for each clinical scenario and the formulation of these recommendations. Consistent with GRADE guidance, the Voting Panel usually offered a strong recommendation in the presence of moderate-or high-quality rating of the evidence, and a conditional recommendation in the presence of very-low or low-quality evidence (although recommendations can also be conditional in the setting of moderate-quality evidence, and in certain circumstances strong in the face of low-quality evidence)</ns0:p><ns0:p>Limitations of the guideline include the limited comparative evidence to inform selection of therapies (i.e., primary comparative benefit/efficacy and harms evidence) and the inability to include all possible clinical scenarios due to the necessity of keeping the task feasible. Because the American Academy of Dermatology and the NPF are currently developing a guideline addressing therapy for psoriasis, our guideline did not address treatment of isolated psoriasis. Another limitation is that we searched only English-language literature. The major limitation of the work arises from the limitations in the evidence.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In this guideline, we often used indirect comparisons among trials/therapies, frequently relying on network meta-analysis. Stratified analyses among subgroups (e.g., treatment-naive, inadequate response to a TNFi biologic agent) were rarely reported separately in primary trials, limiting our ability to perform network metaanalyses in these important subgroups. For most clinical scenarios (PICO questions) there were few or no head-to-head comparison studies identified in the literature review. Thus, the quality of evidence was most often low or very low, and only occasionally moderate (Supplementary Appendix 5;<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.40726/abstract">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/ doi/10.1002/art.40726/abstract</ns0:ref>). This led to nearly all recommendations being conditional, with a few strong recommendations in cases in which there was sufficient evidence (including that from outside of PsA) to make the Voting Panel confident in selecting one option over the comparator. A flow chart or ranking of treatments requires strong recommendation; when recommendations are conditional/weak it means that the right course of action differs between patients. When the right course of action differs between patients, it is inappropriate to make the flow chart and establish treatment ranking or a hierarchy of treatment options</ns0:p><ns0:p>The 2018 ACR/NPF guideline for the treatment of PsA will assist patients and their health care providers in making challenging disease management decisions. More comparative data are needed to inform treatment selection. Several ongoing trials, including a trial to compare a TNFi biologic combination therapy with a TNFi biologic monotherapy and MTX monotherapy , will inform treatment decisions. We anticipate future updates to the guideline when new evidence is available.</ns0:p></ns0:div></ns0:body><ns0:back>
