We did not reexamine all of the 2015 recommendations, but rather focused on those questions for which consequential new evidence was present. We added several new recommendations on how the newly available medications should fit in treatment strategies and on the use of imaging. The target populations are adults with AS or nonradiographic axial SpA. The target users of these recommendations are rheumatologists, primary care clinicians, physiatrists, physical therapists, and others providing care to patients with axial SpA.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>METHODS</ns0:head><ns0:p>These recommendations followed ACR and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/ abstract</ns0:ref>. Briefly, sys te matic literature reviews were done for prespecified clinical population, intervention, comparator, outcomes (PICO) questions. The resulting evidence was reviewed, and recommendations formulated and voted on, by an expert voting panel (see Supplementary Appendices 2-5 at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/ abstract</ns0:ref>).

The decision to use NSAIDs continuously may vary depending on the severity of symptoms, patient preferences, and comorbidities, particularly gastrointestinal and kidney comorbidities, and cardiovascular disease.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs, we conditionally recommend treatment with sulfasalazine, methotrexate, or tofacitinib over no treatment with these medications (new,</ns0:p><ns0:p>Treatment with sulfasalazine is recommended primarily for patients with prominent peripheral arthritis and few or no axial symptoms. However, TNFi may provide a better option for these patients. Evidence for the efficacy of sulfasalazine is based on 8 older controlled trials that showed benefit for peripheral arthritis (see Supplementary Appendix 6, on the Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology web site at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/ abstract</ns0:ref>). Although a recent placebo-controlled trial of sulfasalazine demonstrated improvement in axial symptoms, and modest clinical and imaging responses were seen in a second trial, the preponderance of evidence indicates that sulfasalazine has little benefit for axial symptoms</ns0:p><ns0:p>Three trials of methotrexate with negative results tested doses of ≤10 mg weekly, and the lack of benefit may reflect the low doses used</ns0:p><ns0:p>A phase II study of tofacitinib showed benefit in both clinical and imaging outcomes of axial disease over 12 weeks<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract">http://onlin e libr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/ abstract</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs, we strongly recommend treatment with TNFi over no treatment with TNFi (PICO 6).</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs, we do not recommend any particular TNFi as the preferred choice (PICO 5).</ns0:p><ns0:p>The efficacy of TNFi in patients with active AS has been demonstrated in 24 randomized controlled trials, most of which were short-term (6 months or shorter) placebo-controlled studies. Improvements were shown in patient-reported outcomes, composite response criteria, and spine and sacroiliac inflammation on magnetic resonance imaging<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ art.41042/ abstract</ns0:ref>)</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs, we strongly recommend treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab over no treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab (new, PICO 58).</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs, we conditionally recommend treatment with TNFi over treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab (new, PICO 59).</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs, we conditionally recommend treatment with TNFi over treatment with tofacitinib (new, PICO 60).</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs, we conditionally recommend treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab over treatment with tofacitinib (new, PICO 61).</ns0:p><ns0:p>The use of secukinumab and ixekizumab in patients with active AS is supported by data from large placebo-controlled trials (see Supplementary Appendix 6, on the Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology web site at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/ abstract</ns0:ref>). The panel recommended use of TNFi over secukinumab or ixekizumab based on greater experience with TNFi and familiarity with their long-term safety and toxicity. Similarly, the panel judged that TNFi, secukinumab, or ixekizumab should be used over tofacitinib, given the larger evidence base for TNFi, secukinumab, and ixekizumab. In patients with coexisting ulcerative colitis, if treatment with TNFi is not an option, tofacitinib should be considered over secukinumab or ixekizumab. Interleukin-17 (IL-17) inhibitors have not been shown to be efficacious in IBD, although tofacitinib is an approved treatment for ulcerative colitis</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with active AS despite treatment with NSAIDs and who have contraindications to TNFi, we conditionally recommend treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab over treatment with sulfasalazine, methotrexate, or tofacitinib (new,</ns0:p><ns0:p>No studies have directly compared the risks and benefits of treatment alternatives in patients who have contraindications to treatment with TNFi. The panel favored treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab over treatment with sulfasalazine or methotrexate based on a higher likelihood of benefit, but this recommendation was conditional on the specific contraindication. If the contraindication to TNFi use was the presence of congestive heart failure or demyelinating disease, secukinumab or ixekizumab was preferred, since these medications have not been shown to worsen these conditions. If the contraindication to TNFi use was tuberculosis, other chronic infection, or a high risk of recurrent infections, sulfasalazine was preferred over secukinumab, izekizumab, and tofacitinib. In these cases, efforts to mitigate the infections should be undertaken so that TNFi might safely be used. Treatment with rituximab, abatacept, ustekinumab, or IL-6 inhibitors is not recommended, even in patients with contraindications to TNFi, due to lack of effectiveness.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with active AS despite treatment with the first TNFi used, we conditionally recommend treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab over treatment with a different TNFi in patients with primary nonresponse to TNFi (new,</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with active AS despite treatment with the first TNFi used, we conditionally recommend treatment with a different TNFi over treatment with a non-TNFi biologic in patients with secondary nonresponse to TNFi (new,</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with active AS despite treatment with the first TNFi used, we strongly recommend against switching to treatment with a biosimilar of the first TNFi (new, PICO 62).</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with active AS despite treatment with the first TNFi used, we conditionally recommend against the addition of sulfasalazine or methotrexate in favor of switching to a new biologic (PICO 9).</ns0:p><ns0:p>Direct comparisons of treatment strategies for patients who do not have or sustain adequate responses to their first TNFi have not been reported, and the recommendations are based on the panel's consideration of indirect comparisons among the available treatment options (see Supplementary Appendix 6, at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlin">http:// onlin</ns0:ref>elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/ abstract). Data from observational studies suggest that 25-40% of patients who switch from one TNFi to another will have a meaningful response (e.g., | 1607 50% improvement in Bath AS Disease Activity Index) to the second TNFi</ns0:p><ns0:p>The panel judged that treatment should differ for patients who had a primary nonresponse to TNFi and those with secondary nonresponse to TNFi. Switching to secukinumab or ixekizumab was recommended in most patients who had a primary nonresponse to the first TNFi, under the assumption that TNF was not the key inflammatory mediator in these patients. Continuing treatment with the first TNFi could be considered if additional time was believed important to assess the response fully, or if a higher dose or shorter dosing interval was thought to be beneficial.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In patients who relapse after an initial response (i.e., secondary nonresponse), the panel judged that treatment with a different TNFi held a reasonable prospect of benefit and should be used in most patients, rather than immediately switching to a different class of biologics. Although ixekizumab is efficacious among TNFi nonresponders, trials have not directly compared responses to ixekizumab (or secukinumab) to responses to a second TNFi in patients with a secondary nonresponse to the first TNFi</ns0:p><ns0:p>In cases of nonresponse (primary or secondary), the panel recommended against switching to the biosimilar of the first TNFi (e.g., switching from originator infliximab to infliximab-dyyb), as the clinical response would not be expected to be different. The panel also recommended against the addition of sulfasalazine or methotrexate to TNFi in cases of nonresponse to TNFi, judging any benefit would likely be marginal. The addition of sulfasalazine could be considered in the rare patient whose axial symptoms are well-controlled with TNFi but who has active peripheral arthritis.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with either active or stable AS on treatment with TNFi, we conditionally recommend against co-treatment with low-dose methotrexate (new, PICO 64).</ns0:p><ns0:p>In rheumatoid arthritis, the likelihood of TNFi discontinuation is lower among patients who receive co-treatment with methotrexate, perhaps by reducing the development of antidrug antibodies<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/ abstract</ns0:ref>). Clinical responses were not greater among patients who received co-treatment with methotrexate. In the absence of convincing evidence of benefit, and due to greater burden for patients, the panel recommended against routine co-administration of methotrexate with TNFi, although its use could be considered in patients treated with infliximab.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>B. Recommendations for the treatment of patients with stable AS</ns0:head><ns0:p>In adults with stable AS, we conditionally recommend on-demand treatment with NSAIDs over continuous treatment with NSAIDs (PICO 1).</ns0:p><ns0:p>This recommendation applies to patients whose AS has been stable while not receiving any pharmacologic treatment. In this group, the panel considered that the potential toxicities of continuous NSAID treatment outweighed the uncertain benefit of less radiographic progression. On-demand treatment should be considered for short-term symptom recurrences (flares).</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with stable AS receiving treatment with TNFi and NSAIDs, we conditionally recommend continuing treatment with TNFi alone over continuing both medications (PICO 11).</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with stable AS receiving treatment with TNFi and a conventional synthetic antirheumatic drug, we conditionally recommend continuing treatment with TNFi alone over continuing both medications (</ns0:p><ns0:p>No new studies have directly compared outcomes between patients who continued combination treatment and those who discontinued either NSAIDs or a conventional synthetic antirheumatic drug (csARD). The NSAID-sparing potential of etanercept was demonstrated in a recent trial</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with stable AS receiving treatment with a biologic, we conditionally recommend against discontinuation of the biologic (new, PICO 66).</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with stable AS receiving treatment with a biologic, we conditionally recommend against tapering of the biologic dose as a standard approach (new, PICO 65).</ns0:p><ns0:p>Data from several observational studies suggest that discontinuation of TNFi after achieving either remission or low disease activity results in relapses in 60-74% of patients, occasionally within a few weeks to months from discontinuation (see Supplementary Appendix 6, available at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary. wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/ abstract</ns0:ref>). Although the data only concerned TNFi discontinuation, the panel judged that a similar recommendation would also apply to other biologics. In general, treatment with a biologic should be planned to be continued long-term, barring toxicities. Discontinuation might be considered in patients in sustained remission (i.e., several years), with the anticipation that only one-third of patients would not experience relapse. Patient preferences should help guide this decision.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Tapering of TNFi could entail a change in either the dose or frequency of administration. Two controlled unblinded trials of tapering etanercept to 25 mg weekly versus maintaining the dose at 50 mg weekly in patients with stable AS showed that remission or partial remission was somewhat less likely among those in whom etanercept was tapered<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract">http://onlinelibrary. wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract</ns0:ref>). Therefore, the panel recommended against tapering of biologics as a standard approach. One condition in which tapering could be considered would be in patients with prolonged stable AS, if the patient and provider engage in shared decision-making.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with stable AS receiving an originator TNFi, we strongly recommend continuing treatment with the originator TNFi over mandated switching to its biosimilar (new, PICO 63).</ns0:p><ns0:p>While the efficacy of originator and biosimilar TNFi is comparable, and although either could be chosen to initiate new courses of TNFi treatment, it was the opinion of the panel to recommend against mandated switching to a biosimilar during the course of treatment, in the absence of evidence of interchangability. Medication changes can increase the risk of destabilizing a patient's condition, and the panel judged that additional data were needed to understand the frequency of potential problems and concerns associated with switching patients who were stable on an originator TNFi to its biosimilar. Given these concerns, the panel judged that there should be a compelling rationale for switching medications, particularly in light of the marginal cost savings apparent for US patients</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>C. Recommendations for adults with AS-related comorbidities</ns0:head><ns0:p>In adults with AS and recurrent uveitis, we conditionally recommend treatment with TNFi monoclonal antibodies over treatment with other biologics (PICO 29).</ns0:p><ns0:p>Evidence for this recommendation is limited to indirect comparisons of the rates of acute uveitis episodes in clinical trials or observational studies, rather than from direct comparisons (see Supplementary Appendix 6, available at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley. com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/ abstract</ns0:ref>). Many reports showed overall rates of uveitis without separately reporting recurrences as opposed to incident episodes</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with AS and IBD, we conditionally recommend treatment with TNFi monoclonal antibodies over treatment with other biologics (PICO 32).</ns0:p><ns0:p>This recommendation was based on limited indirect evidence on the risks of flares or new onset of IBD among patients with AS during treatment with biologics, and the much larger literature on the treatment of IBD in general. Patients with AS treated with infliximab or adalimumab have lower risks of IBD exacerbations than those treated with etanercept (see Supplementary Appendix 6, on the Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology web site at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/ abstract</ns0:ref>). Infliximab, adalimumab, and certolizumab are approved for the treatment of Crohn's disease, and infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab are approved for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, while etanercept is not approved for either condition</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>D. Recommendations for the treatment of patients with either active or stable nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis</ns0:head><ns0:p>Parallel questions on pharmacologic treatment were investigated for patients with nonradiographic axial SpA. There were no relevant published data for 19 questions. There was high-quality evidence only for the use of TNFi in nonradiographic axial SpA, which was examined in several clinical trials. Low-quality or very low-quality evidence from single studies suggested no differences in outcomes among different TNFi in nonradiographic axial SpA, high likelihood of relapse following discontinuation of TNFi, and no association between co-treatment with nonbiologics and TNFi persistence (see Supplementary Appendix 6, available at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/ abstract</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>| 1609</ns0:head><ns0:p>Therefore, the recommendations for nonradiographic axial SpA were largely extrapolated from evidence in AS (Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ns0:ref>). The recommendations were identical in both patient groups with 1 notable exception: treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab was strongly recommended over no treatment with secukinumab or ixekizumab in patients with AS, while use of these medications was conditionally recommended in patients with nonradiographic axial SPA, because trials in nonradiographic axial SPA have not been reported. Evidence on tofacitinib in nonradiographic axial SpA has not been reported.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>E. Disease activity assessment and imaging</ns0:head><ns0:p>In adults with active AS, we conditionally recommend against using the treat-to-target strategy, which aims at a target of an Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score &lt;1.3 (or 2.1), over a treatment strategy based on physician assessment (new, PICO 67).</ns0:p><ns0:p>The concept of treat-to-target strategies is well-founded in chronic disease management for conditions that have an accurate measure of disease activity (often one that is asymptomatic, as in blood pressure or glycosylated hemoglobin), a tight link between this disease activity measure and future health outcomes, and evidence that maintaining a particular target in the disease activity measure is closely associated with better long-term health</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with AS of unclear activity while receiving a biologic, we conditionally recommend obtaining a spinal or pelvis MRI to assess activity (new, PICO 68).</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with nonradiographic axial SpA of unclear activity while receiving a biologic, we conditionally recommend obtaining a pelvis MRI to assess activity (new, PICO 81).</ns0:p><ns0:p>Because physical and laboratory measures are often normal despite active axial SpA, and because symptoms may be nonspecific, it may be difficult to know whether a patient is experiencing inflammation that warrants a change in treatment. Limited evidence suggests that knowledge of MRI findings in the spine and sacroiliac joints may alter treatment recommendations. However, the degree of inflammatory change on MRI may not correlate with treatment responses, and the location of inflam-mation on MRI may not correlate with the location of pain<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary. wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/ abstract</ns0:ref>). The panel judged that MRI could provide useful information in cases where the level of disease activity was unclear and where this information would influence treatment decisions. For patients with nonradiographic axial SpA, the imaging should focus on the sacroiliac joints. In interpreting MRI results, it is important to keep in mind the range and frequency of abnormalities, including bone marrow edema lesions, that may occur in individuals without axial SpA and that may not represent inflammation due to axial SpA</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with stable AS, we conditionally recommend against obtaining a spinal or pelvis MRI to confirm inactivity (new, PICO 69).</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with stable nonradiographic axial SpA, we conditionally recommend against obtaining a spine or pelvis MRI to confirm inactivity (new, PICO 82).</ns0:p><ns0:p>Because the clinical assessment of inflammation in axial SpA has many limitations, questions may arise about whether subclinical inflammation that could be detected by MRI is being "missed" by either the physical examination, symptoms, or laboratory studies. Given the lack of evidence that obtaining an MRI in stable patients improves clinical outcomes, the only moderate sensitivity and specificity of MRI-defined abnormalities for measurement of activity in axial SpA, the burden of testing, and concern for possible overtreatment, the panel recommended against obtaining an MRI in this setting. MRI could be considered in circumstances where the clinician and patient differ in their assessment of whether the disease is stable.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with active or stable AS receiving any treatment, we conditionally recommend against obtaining repeat spine radiographs at a scheduled interval (e.g., every 2 years) as a standard approach (new, PICO 70).</ns0:p><ns0:p>In adults with active or stable nonradiographic axial SpA on any treatment, we conditionally recommend against obtaining repeat spine radiographs at a scheduled interval (e.g., every 2 years) as a standard approach (new, PICO 83).</ns0:p><ns0:p>Spine radiographs are useful for the diagnosis of axial SpA, in evaluating the extent of spinal fusion, and for investigating new spinal pain in patients with established AS. In research studies, small changes in the extent of spine damage can be detected in 20-35% of patients with AS over a 2-year interval (see Supplementary Appendix 6, available at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41042/ abstract</ns0:ref>). There is no evidence that monitoring serial changes in | 1611 spine radiographs at a regular interval leads to better patient outcomes, and data balancing a clinical benefit with the risk of radiation exposure are absent. Therefore, the panel recommended against repeating spine radiographs as a standard approach. In the absence of clinical indications, repeat spine radiographs could be considered on an ad hoc basis for counseling patients on the progression of their disease, which may help in career and life planning.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>F. Summary of recommendations</ns0:head><ns0:p>Figure<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ns0:ref>presents a diagram of the main treatment recommendations for active and stable AS, integrating the new recommendations with the 2015 recommendations that were not updated in this review.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>DISCUSSION</ns0:head><ns0:p>This update was primarily motivated by the availability of new treatment options, notably secukinumab, ixekizumab, tofacitinib, and TNFi biosimilars, for patients with axial SpA. Providers and patients have questions on where these new medications fit in the pharmacologic strategy, and how originator TNFi, sulfasalazine, and NSAIDs should be used given these new options. Based on the current evidence and the considerations of the panel, NSAIDs and TNFi remain the primary classes of medications for the treatment of AS and nonradiographic axial SpA. Secukinumab or ixekizumab is recommended for patients with active disease who have heart failure or demyelinating disease as a contraindication to TNFi, and in primary nonresponders to TNFi. Secukinumab and ixekizumab are not recommended in patients with IBD or recurrent uveitis, as TNFi monoclonal antibodies are better options. Tofacitinib is a potential second-line option for patients with contraindications to TNFi other than infections. Recommendations regarding tofacitinib may change pending the results of larger clinical trials.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Several of the 2015 recommendations were modified in this update. The current recommendation is conditionally in favor of use of sulfasalazine in limited clinical circumstances, whereas the 2015 recommendations had this as an exception to the general recommendation against the use of conventional synthetic antirheumatic drugs. In the 2015 recommendations, sulfasalazine and pamidronate were suggested as alternatives for the treatment of patients with active disease and contraindications to TNFi, while the current recommendations suggest use of secukinumab or ixekizumab in most of these cases (except patients with high risk of infections). In cases of failure of TNFi, the 2015 guidelines included a conditional recommendation for a trial of a second TNFi and against use of a non-TNFi biologic, whereas the current guidelines differentiate treatment recommendations based on whether there was primary or secondary nonresponse to the TNFi. For the treatment of patients with recurrent uveitis, the previous guidelines specified conditional use of infliximab or adalimumab, while the update broadened this recommendation to include TNFi monoclonal antibodies generally. Similarly, for patients with coexisting IBD, the update includes a conditional recommendation for TNFi monoclonal antibodies over other biologics, rather than over only etanercept. Finally, the recommendation for use of TNFi in patients with active nonradiographic axial SpA was changed from conditional to strong.</ns0:p><ns0:p>New questions on the treatment of patients with stable disease were addressed in this update. Discontinuation of biologics is not recommended due to the likelihood for symptom recurrence. If tapering is considered, patients should be counseled regarding the potential for increased disease activity. Co-treatment with low-dose methotrexate is not generally recommended, but ongoing studies will shed further light on this question. Switching to a biosimilar during the course of treatment with TNFi is also not recommended, echoing the concerns previously expressed by the ACR</ns0:p><ns0:p>Imaging remains a central tool in the diagnosis of axial SpA, but its role in monitoring patients is less well-defined. Spine and/or pelvis MRI could aid in the evaluation of patients in whom the degree of active inflammation is uncertain, and especially in those for whom the findings would change management. MRI is not recommended to seek subclinical inflammation in patients with stable disease (as defined in Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ns0:ref>). However, MRI could be considered in circumstances where it may inform shared decision-making. We recommend against obtaining spine radiographs on scheduled intervals to monitor progression. This practice entails radiation exposure and would not alter treatment in most cases.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We used the GRADE method to develop these treatment recommendations in a way that was transparent, systematic, and explicit, and that was informed by the medical evidence as well as patient preferences. The major limitation of these guidelines is the very low quality of evidence for many recommendations, which necessitated reliance on the clinical expertise of the panel. For nonradiographic axial SpA, most recommendations were based on extrapolation of results from studies in AS. We tried to identify the most common and consequential treatment questions, so that the recommendations would be useful in guiding clinical decision-making. The low quality of evidence for many questions is an indication that research has not yet tackled many of the most important treatment questions. As more treatment options become available, this problem will grow. Importantly, failure to recommend a particular medication does not imply that it is contraindicated. Key evidence gaps include the comparative effectiveness and safety of different biologics, the optimal sequencing of treatments, and the role of NSAIDs.</ns0:p><ns0:p>This update addressed only a subset of treatment questions. The 2015 recommendations that were not reexamined are to be considered extant. Recommendations are meant to describe the approach to treatment of the typical patient and cannot anticipate all possible clinical scenarios. Application of these recommendations must be individualized, and requires careful assessment, sound clinical judgment of each patient's circumstances, and consideration of a patient's preferences.</ns0:p></ns0:div></ns0:body><ns0:back>
