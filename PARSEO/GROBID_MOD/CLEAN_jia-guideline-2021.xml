		<ns0:body><ns0:div><ns0:head>INTRODUCTION</ns0:head><ns0:p>Reflecting the changing medical landscape, the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) regularly updates clinical practice guidelines and plans to review these annually and update as needed. The process for updating the 2011 and 2013 juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) guidelines</ns0:p><ns0:p>Following the selection of topics, we developed clinically relevant Patient/Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes (PICO) questions. Using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology, recommendations were then developed based on the best available evidence for commonly encountered clinical scenarios. Prior to final voting, input was sought from relevant stakeholders, including a panel of young adults with JIA and caregivers of children with JIA, to consider their values and perspectives in making recommendations. Both the patient/caregiver and guideline Voting Panels stressed the need for individualized treatment while being mindful of available evidence. includes a detailed description of the methods. Briefly, the Core Leadership Team (KBO, DBH, DJL, SS) drafted clinical PICO questions. PICO questions were revised and finalized based on feedback from the entire guideline development group and the public. The Literature Review Team performed systematic literature reviews for each PICO (for search terms, see Supplementary Appendix 2,<ns0:ref type="url" target="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/</ns0:ref>art.42037/abstract), graded the quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, or very low), and produced the evidence report (Supplementary Appendix 3,<ns0:ref type="url" target="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.42037/">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.42037/</ns0:ref>abstract). It should be noted that GRADE methodology does not distinguish between lack of evidence (i.e., none) and very lowquality evidence. The Core Team defined multiple critical study outcome(s) for PICOs relevant to each JIA phenotype (Supplementary Appendix 4,<ns0:ref type="url" target="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/</ns0:ref>art.42037/abstract).</ns0:p><ns0:p>A panel of 15 members, including young adults with JIA and caregivers of children with JIA, met virtually (moderated by the principal investigator [KBO]), reviewed the evidence report, and provided input to the Voting Panel. Two members of this panel were also members of the Voting Panel to ensure that the patient voice was part of the entire process. The Voting Panel reviewed the evidence report and patient/caregiver perspectives and then discussed and voted on recommendation statements. Consensus required ≥70% agreement on both direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation, as per ACR practice. A recommendation could be either in favor of or against the proposed intervention and either strong or conditional. According to GRADE, a recommendation is categorized as strong if the panel is very confident that the benefits of an intervention clearly outweigh the harms (or vice versa); a conditional recommendation denotes uncertainty regarding the balance of benefits and harms, such as when the evidence quality is low or very low, or when the decision is sensitive to individual patient preferences, or when costs are expected to impact the decision. Thus, conditional recommendations refer to decisions in which incorporation of patient preferences is a particularly essential element of decision-making. Examples of each class of pharmacologic intervention addressed in the recommendations are shown in Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Rosters of the Core Leadership Team, Literature Review Team, and both panels are included in Supplementary Appendix 5 (<ns0:ref type="url" target="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.42037/abstract">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.42037/abstract</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Guiding principles</ns0:head><ns0:p>The development of the recommendations presented herein was guided by the following principles:</ns0:p><ns0:p>1. Consistent with the ACR's 2019 JIA guidelines, these recommendations are for persons already diagnosed as having JIA. 2. Aside from poor prognostic features specified within the recommendations themselves (e.g., specific joints for oligoarthritis, macrophage activation syndrome [MAS]), coexisting extraarticular conditions that would influence disease management, such as uveitis, psoriasis, or inflammatory bowel disease, are not addressed within these guidelines. 3. Recommendations are intended to be used by all clinicians caring for persons with JIA and assume that patients do not have contraindications to the recommended pharmacologic treatments. 4. Longer-term glucocorticoid therapy in childhood is not appropriate because of its effects on bone health and growth. Thus, wherever glucocorticoids are suggested, recommended treatment should be limited to the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible. 5. Shared decision-making with families and patients is important when considering treatment options.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>RESULTS/RECOMMENDATIONS</ns0:head><ns0:p>The initial literature review included topics addressed in this report and in the second report<ns0:ref type="url" target="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/</ns0:ref>art.42037/abstract), leaving 445 articles to be considered for the evidence report. Ultimately, 336 articles were matched to PICO questions and included in the final evidence report. Quality of evidence was uniformly low or very low; 17 PICO questions lacked any associated evidence and as per GRADE methodology were categorized as very low (Tables<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ns0:ref>). The recommendations that follow are based on 62 PICO questions. Several PICO questions were split into 24 sub-PICO questions to improve specificity. Nine questions initially posed were discarded by the Voting Panel because of redundancy or lack of relevance. Final recommendations are described below and in Tables<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ns0:ref>, which include reference(s) to which PICO question(s) in the evidence report correspond to the recommendation statement.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Active oligoarthritis (Figure<ns0:ref type="figure">1</ns0:ref>and Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_2">3</ns0:ref>)</ns0:p><ns0:p>Oligoarthritis refers to JIA presenting with involvement of ≤4 joints without systemic manifestations. It may include patients with different categories of JIA  but who share in common limited numbers of joints involved; guidance for patients with active uveitis, sacroiliitis, or enthesitis can be found in the 2019 guidelines</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</ns0:head><ns0:p>A trial of scheduled NSAIDs is conditionally recommended as part of initial therapy for active oligoarthritis.</ns0:p><ns0:p>NSAIDs have long been the cornerstone of treatment for oligoarthritis and can ease discomfort . However, the initial NSAID trial should be brief due to potential adverse effects (e.g., gastritis, bruising) and limited efficacy (unless inactive disease is achieved). Voting panelists could not agree on the appropriate duration of initial use before escalating therapy, as some panelists prefer that the use of NSAIDs be avoided altogether.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Glucocorticoids</ns0:head><ns0:p>Intraarticular glucocorticoids (IAGCs) are strongly recommended as part of initial therapy for active oligoarthritis.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Triamcinolone hexacetonide is strongly recommended as the preferred agent.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Although the evidence is of low quality, IAGCs are strongly recommended due to low potential of adverse effects and high likelihood of sustained response</ns0:p><ns0:p>Oral glucocorticoids are conditionally recommended against as part of initial therapy for active oligoarthritis.</ns0:p><ns0:p>If, despite recommendations against, oral glucocorticoids are given to quickly alleviate severe symptoms when an IAGC is not available or feasible, or prior to the onset of action of disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), treatment should be limited to the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration possible</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Conventional synthetic DMARDs (csDMARDs)</ns0:head><ns0:p>Conventional synthetic DMARDs are strongly recommended if there is an inadequate response to scheduled NSAIDs and/or IAGCs for active oligoarthritis.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Methotrexate is conditionally recommended as a preferred agent over leflunomide, sulfasalazine, or hydroxychloroquine (in that order).</ns0:p><ns0:p>Despite an absence of comparator trials, methotrexate is the preferred agent, given the preponderance of evidence showing its long-term safety and efficacy in children</ns0:p><ns0:p>With regard to the route of administration of methotrexate, the 2019 JIA guidelines conditionally recommended subcutaneous over oral administration for polyarthritis . This recommendation was conditional because the supporting evidence was of very low quality and patient preferences may guide choice of route of administration. There is little reason to suggest that methotrexate should be used differently in oligoarthritis than in polyarthritis.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Biologic DMARDs (bDMARDs)</ns0:head><ns0:p>Biologic DMARDs are strongly recommended if there is inadequate response to or intolerance of NSAIDs and/or IAGCs and at least 1 csDMARD for active oligoarthritis.</ns0:p><ns0:p>There is no preferred bDMARD. Biologic DMARDs are preferred over combining csDMARDs or switching to a different csDMARD, due to a greater likelihood that bDMARDs will yield rapid and sustained improvement in JIA</ns0:p><ns0:p>Although tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) are the most commonly used bDMARDs in children</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Risk factors for poor prognosis and disease activity measures</ns0:head><ns0:p>Consideration of risk factors for poor outcome (e.g., involvement of ankle, wrist, hip, sacroiliac joint, and/or TMJ, presence of erosive disease or enthesitis, delay in diagnosis, elevated levels of inflammation markers, symmetric disease) is conditionally recommended to guide treatment decisions.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Use of validated disease activity measures is conditionally recommended to guide treatment decisions, especially to facilitate treat-to-target approaches.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Treatment for oligoarthritis can and should be modified based on the involvement of specific joints or disease features</ns0:p><ns0:p>Voting panelists conditionally recommended formal assessment of disease activity using validated measures. There are several validated disease activity measures for childhood arthritis</ns0:p><ns0:p>Treat-to-target approaches have been strongly endorsed for polyarticular JIA</ns0:p><ns0:p>Active TMJ arthritis (Figure<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">2</ns0:ref>and Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_3">4</ns0:ref>) TMJ disease may be isolated or part of generalized arthritis. Treatment of TMJ arthritis is critical, as patients/caregivers noted high impact on oral health-related quality of life and challenges with diagnosis and effective pharmacologic treatment</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>NSAIDs</ns0:head><ns0:p>A trial of scheduled NSAIDs is conditionally recommended as part of initial therapy for active TMJ arthritis.</ns0:p><ns0:p>NSAIDs have long been the cornerstone of treatment for JIA and can ease discomfort .

Voting panelists deferred recommending a specific bDMARD because current studies of TMJ arthritis have been small and observational</ns0:p><ns0:p>Systemic JIA with and without MAS (Figure<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">3</ns0:ref>) Systemic JIA is distinct from all other categories of JIA due to fever, rash, and visceral involvement and is considered by some to be an autoinflammatory disorder</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Systemic JIA without MAS: initial therapy (Table 5)</ns0:head></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Biologic DMARDs</ns0:head><ns0:p>Biologic DMARDS (IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors) are conditionally recommended as initial monotherapy for systemic JIA without MAS. There is no preferred agent. IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors are extremely effective and welltolerated treatments for systemic JIA  and have been rapidly adopted in clinical practice</ns0:p><ns0:p>Some voting panelists preferred starting with a short-acting agent such as anakinra, but in the absence of controlled studies, no preferred agent was endorsed. Patients/caregivers noted preference for fewer injections, if possible. As response to individual agents is variable, switching among and between IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors when needed due to lack of efficacy or poor tolerability is appropriate.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Concerns were expressed regarding a highly fatal lung disease observed in some children with systemic JIA, most of whom were treated with bDMARDs. Observed risk factors include younger age with MAS, a history of reactions to tocilizumab, and trisomy 21</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>NSAIDs</ns0:head><ns0:p>NSAIDs are conditionally recommended as initial monotherapy for systemic JIA without MAS.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Studies suggest that a small proportion of patients with systemic JIA will respond to NSAIDs alone</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Glucocorticoids</ns0:head><ns0:p>Oral glucocorticoids are conditionally recommended against as initial monotherapy for systemic JIA without MAS.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In most cases, oral glucocorticoids should not be used as initial monotherapy in patients with systemic JIA without MAS and, if used, should be limited to the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration possible. This recommendation is conditional, as bDMARDs may not always be immediately available, and glucocorticoids may help control systemic and joint manifestations until IL-1 or IL-6 inhibitors can be started.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Conventional synthetic DMARDs</ns0:head><ns0:p>Conventional synthetic DMARDs are strongly recommended against as initial monotherapy for systemic JIA without MAS.</ns0:p><ns0:p>This recommendation is strong despite limited evidence, as the Voting Panel noted multiple small studies of systemic JIA that documented lack of efficacy at controlling systemic features that are typically present at onset of disease, leading to a continued need for glucocorticoids</ns0:p><ns0:p>Systemic JIA without MAS: subsequent therapy (Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_4">5</ns0:ref>)</ns0:p><ns0:p>IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors are strongly recommended over a single or combination of csDMARDs for inadequate response to or intolerance of NSAIDs and/or glucocorticoids for systemic JIA without MAS.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Most physicians and patients/caregivers preferred quickly starting IL-1 or IL-6 inhibitors for insufficient response to NSAIDs or glucocorticoids</ns0:p><ns0:p>Biologic DMARDs or conventional synthetic DMARDs are strongly recommended over long-term glucocorticoids for residual arthritis and incomplete response to IL-1 and/or IL-6 inhibitors.</ns0:p><ns0:p>There is no preferred agent.

IL-1 and IL-6 inhibitors have proven to be very helpful in the treatment of systemic JIA and MAS</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Glucocorticoids</ns0:head><ns0:p>Glucocorticoids are conditionally recommended as part of initial treatment of systemic JIA with MAS.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The benefits of glucocorticoids for MAS often outweigh their risks, even in patients whose MAS is triggered by infection. Systemic glucocorticoids may be necessary for severely ill patients because they can have a rapid onset of action. However, although treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids may be required for disease control, subsequent glucocorticoid therapy should be limited to the lowest effective dosage for the shortest duration possible. Longer-term glucocorticoid therapy in children is not appropriate because of its effects on bone health and growth</ns0:p><ns0:p>Systemic JIA with MAS: subsequent therapy (Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_5">6</ns0:ref>)</ns0:p><ns0:p>Biologic DMARDS or csDMARDs are strongly recommended over long-term glucocorticoids for residual arthritis and incomplete response to IL-1 and/or IL-6 inhibitors.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Inactive systemic JIA with or without history of MAS (Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_6">7</ns0:ref>)</ns0:p><ns0:p>Tapering and discontinuing glucocorticoids is strongly recommended after inactive disease has been attained in systemic JIA.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The risk of flare from systemic JIA that is well controlled is considerably outweighed by possible harms from long-term glucocorticoid use, even at low doses</ns0:p><ns0:p>Tapering and discontinuing bDMARDs is conditionally recommended after inactive disease has been attained in systemic JIA.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In children with systemic JIA whose disease is inactive, it may be possible to maintain this inactive disease state with lower doses of, or discontinuation of, bDMARDs<ns0:ref type="formula">86</ns0:ref>), but patients/caregivers tended to prefer increasing intervals.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>DISCUSSION</ns0:head><ns0:p>The recommendations presented herein are a companion to those published in 2019</ns0:p><ns0:p>The Voting Panel and Patient/Caregiver Panel both engaged in vigorous discussions over the use of NSAIDs and oral glucocorticoids</ns0:p><ns0:p>Another major change in recommendations for the treatment of systemic JIA is the use of bDMARDs as initial treatment or upon inadequate response to a short course of NSAIDs. The addition of csDMARDs is recommended only for persistent synovitis despite treatment with bDMARDs. This recommendation reflects growing understanding about the roles of specific cytokines in systemic JIA and the ability to induce remission with targeted therapy against IL-6 and IL-1</ns0:p><ns0:p>The use of IAGCs was extensively discussed. Recommendations from 2011 and 2019 to preferentially use triamcinolone hexacetonide for oligoarthritis</ns0:p><ns0:p>There is much that remains to be learned. Studies must be performed to obtain high-quality data to fill in the evidentiary gaps (Supplementary Appendix 7, available on the Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology website at<ns0:ref type="url" target="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/</ns0:ref>10.1002/art.42037/abstract). There remain important areas with little or no evidence to guide management, suggesting an agenda for future research. Head-to-head trials are needed to understand the optimal order and roles of csDMARDs and bDMARDs for children with JIA. We need improved understanding of which class of medication is best for a particular child, allowing for more precise treatment and less time before remission is attained. Biosimilars were not addressed in this guideline, as these medications were not included in the literature review, and there was no available evidence assessing their use in JIA. More widespread use of biosimilars will add more questions about their relative safety and effectiveness in children who start or switch to them for JIA treatment.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Patient/caregiver input was instrumental in creating these recommendations. Several major themes emerged from their participation. Patients/caregivers stressed the need for individualizing treatments because what works for one does not work for all . To facilitate individualization, no rigid time frames were required for an advancement of treatment. Moving quickly may be needed for a patient whose condition is rapidly worsening, while moving more slowly may be appropriate for one whose condition has improved substantially but not fully. Panel participants emphasized the critical importance of shared decision-making that considers patients' and caregivers' values, goals, and preferences</ns0:p><ns0:p>This guideline breaks new ground in recommending treatment withdrawal for children with systemic JIA, who may have lower risks of flare than are associated with other forms of JIA</ns0:p><ns0:p>The low quality of evidence supporting these recommendations underscores the importance of clinical judgment and shared decision-making in everyday care of individuals with JIA. Similarly, this guideline and the many uncertainties acknowledged herein represent a powerful reminder of the need for more high-quality evidence to support (or refute) current practices and to improve the management of JIA and well-being of all individuals living with the disease.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:note place="foot" xml:id="foot_0"><ns0:p>23265205, 2022, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.42037, Wiley Online Library on [12/04/2023].
