		<ns0:body><ns0:div><ns0:head>INTRODUCTION</ns0:head><ns0:p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, systemic inflammatory condition, and improved outcomes occur with early diagnosis, evaluation, and management. The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has previously published pharmacologic guidelines to aid clinicians and individuals with RA<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ns0:ref>; the critical outcomes were pain and physical function, and for select interventions, disease activity or work outcomes. Although individuals with RA may have other indications for these interventions (e.g., comorbidities), this guideline focuses specifically on managing RA.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>METHODS</ns0:head><ns0:p>This guideline follows the ACR guideline development process and ACR policy guiding management of conflicts of interest and disclosures (<ns0:ref type="url" target="https://rheumatology.org/clinical-practiceguidelines">https://rheumatology.org/clinical-practiceguidelines</ns0:ref>), which includes GRADE methodology<ns0:ref type="url" target="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25117">https:// onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25117</ns0:ref>) includes a detailed description of the methods. Briefly, the Core Leadership Team (BRE, BJS, NAB, JLB, CAO, and GG) drafted clinical Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcome (PICO) questions with input from the rest of the guideline development group, and these were posted online for public comment (see Supplementary Appendix 2,<ns0:ref type="url" target="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25117">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr. 25117</ns0:ref>). For most questions, the critical outcomes were physical function, which refers to the ability to perform both basic and instrumental activities of daily living, and pain. Disease activity was an additional critical outcome for questions pertaining to diet and dietary supplements. Work outcomes were additional critical outcomes for questions pertaining to vocational rehabilitation and work site evaluation and modification.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The Literature Review Team performed a systematic literature review for all PICO questions, extracted relevant study data, graded the quality of evidence (high, moderate, low, very low), and produced the evidence report (see Supplementary Appendix 3,<ns0:ref type="url" target="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25117">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25117</ns0:ref>). A Patient Panel of 12 patients with varying manifestations of RA and varying experiences with the considered interventions for RA management met virtually. This panel was moderated by a member of the Core Team (JLB) and Literature Review Team (LT). The panel reviewed the evidence report (along with a summary and interpretation by the moderator) and provided patient perspectives and preferences for consideration by the Voting Panel. At a separate Voting Panel meeting held virtually, the resulting evidence was reviewed, patient perspectives considered, and recommendations formulated and voted on. Three members of the Patient Panel were also members of the Voting Panel, to ensure the Patient Panel's perspective was considered when final decisions on the recommendations were made. Rosters of the Consensus among the Voting Panel members required â‰¥70% agreement on both directions (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation, as per ACR practice. According to GRADE, a recommendation is categorized as strong if the panel is very confident that the benefits of an intervention clearly outweigh the harms (or vice versa); a conditional recommendation denotes uncertainty regarding the balance of benefits and harms, such as when the evidence quality is low or very low, or when the decision is particularly sensitive to individual patient preferences, or when costs are expected to affect the decision. Thus, conditional recommendations refer to decisions in which incorporation of patient preferences and values is an essential element of shared decision-making.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Guiding principles</ns0:head><ns0:p>Nine guiding principles (Table<ns0:ref type="table">2</ns0:ref>) were established by the Core Leadership Team to aid in the preparation of this guideline. These guiding principles specify that integrative interventions considered in this guideline should complement pharmacologic treatments, an interprofessional approach for the management of RA should be used, and shared decision-making is needed when caring for people with RA.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>RESULTS/RECOMMENDATIONS</ns0:head></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Exercise recommendations (Table 3)</ns0:head><ns0:p>We strongly recommend consistent engagement in exercise over no exercise.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We recommend consistent engagement in exercise over no exercise based on moderate certainty evidence suggesting that regular exercise results in improved physical function and pain in there are other guideline efforts that address large joint replacement, and small joint surgeries are not frequently a part of the current management of rheumatoid arthritis. Disease activity and disease activity levels refer to those calculated using an ACR-endorsed rheumatoid arthritis disease activity measure</ns0:p><ns0:p>* ACR = American College of Rheumatology.</ns0:p><ns0:p>individuals with RA. Aerobic, resistance, aquatic, and mind-body exercise were considered together in the evidence supporting this recommendation. The exercise type, frequency, intensity, and duration were not formally defined because the evidence on exercise interventions did not support such precision in the recommendation, and there is considerable variation in patient values, preferences, and access to different types of exercise. The specific elements of an exercise intervention should be tailored to each person at the given time in their disease trajectory, considering their capabilities, access, and other health conditions. National physical activity guidelines can aid such instruction .</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend consistent engagement in aerobic exercise over no exercise.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We recommend consistent engagement in aerobic exercise based on very low to low certainty evidence suggesting that it results in improved physical function but moderate certainty evidence suggesting there is no difference in pain. The recommendation is conditional because of the level of certainty of the evidence and recognizing that patient preferences may vary due to RA disease activity level, the presence of joint damage or deformities, comorbidities, and the cost of, access to, or burden of engaging in consistent aerobic exercise.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend consistent engagement in aquatic exercise over no exercise.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We recommend consistent engagement in aquatic exercise based on low certainty evidence to indicate that it results in improvement in physical function but no difference in pain. The recommendation is conditional because of the level of certainty of the evidence, the variability in patient preferences related to comfort in engaging in water activities, and the variations in the cost of, access to, and burden of aquatic exercise.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend consistent engagement in resistance exercise over no exercise.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We recommend consistent engagement in resistance exercise based on very low to low certainty evidence to indicate that it results in improvement in physical function (inferred from performance measures) and pain. The recommendation is conditional because of the level of certainty of the evidence, variability in patient preferences related to joint damage or deformities that may limit participation, and variations in the access to, cost of, and burden of resistance exercise. The Voting Panel and Patient Panel emphasized the importance of appropriate prescription and supervision of resistance exercise by physical therapists or other qualified exercise professionals to prevent harm.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend consistent engagement in mind-body exercise over no exercise.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We recommend consistent engagement in mind-body exercise (e.g., yoga, Tai Chi, Qigong) based on very low to low certainty evidence suggesting that it results in improved physical function but no difference in pain. The recommendation is conditional because of the level of certainty of the evidence, variability in patient preferences, and variations in the cost of, access to, and burden of this type of activity.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Rehabilitation recommendations (Table 4)</ns0:head><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend participation in comprehensive occupational therapy (OT) over no comprehensive OT.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend participation in comprehensive physical therapy (PT) over no comprehensive PT.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend that individuals with RA participate in comprehensive OT and PT based on very low certainty evidence to indicate that it results in improvement in pain and physical function, expected variability in patient preferences, and variations in the burden of, access to, and cost of these approaches. In these recommendations, "comprehensive" refers to the numerous different approaches and interventions that occupational therapists and physical therapists utilize in the assessment and management of individuals with RA. The comprehensive nature of these interventions also highlights the importance of identifying occupational therapists and physical therapists with expertise in tailoring these interventions to the management of RA through a For patients with hand involvement, we conditionally recommend performance of hand therapy over no hand therapy exercises.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend that RA patients with hand involvement undergo hand therapy exercises based on low certainty evidence indicating that hand therapy results in pain reduction and improvement in physical function. Therapists and patients on the Voting Panel acknowledged that the evaluation of the unique needs of the RA patient with hand involvement may be best performed by an experienced hand therapist (e.g., a certified hand therapist, who is typically an occupational or physical therapist with additional training) who can guide the specific design and intensity of the intervention.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For patients with hand and/or wrist involvement and/or deformity, we conditionally recommend use of splinting, orthoses, and/or compression over no splinting, orthoses, and/or compression.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For patients with foot and/or ankle involvement, we conditionally recommend use of bracing, orthoses, and/or taping over no bracing, orthoses, and/or compression. For patients with knee involvement, we conditionally recommend use of bracing and/or orthoses over no bracing and/or orthoses.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend use of splinting, orthoses, and/or compression among individuals with hand/wrist involvement, use of bracing, orthoses, and/or taping among individuals with foot/ankle involvement, and use of bracing and/or orthoses among individuals with knee involvement. These recommendations are based on very low certainty evidence to indicate that these approaches improve pain and physical function at the hand/wrist and foot/ankle. No studies pertaining to the use of these approaches for patients with knee involvement met the eligibility criteria. Although the Patient Panel discussed the discomfort and burden accompanying the periodic and regular use of these interventions, the Patient Panel and Voting Panel also recognized their potential to reduce pain and improve physical function. In addition, although these interventions are available without a prescription, the Voting Panel recommends their prescription and use under the guidance of an experienced occupational therapist or physical therapist to ensure appropriate item selection and fit.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend use of joint protection techniques over no joint protection techniques.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend use of joint protection techniques based on low certainty evidence to indicate that it results in improved pain and function. Experienced healthcare professional guidance in joint protection techniques at various stages of a patient's experience with RA is vital for this intervention, in order to aid the patient in maintaining physical function. The Voting Panel also stressed the importance of proper patient education in joint protection techniques by occupational or physical therapists.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend use of activity pacing, energy conservation, activity modification, and/or fatigue management over no activity pacing, energy conservation, activity modification, and/or fatigue management.</ns0:p><ns0:p>There was no evidence found to support the conditional recommendation that individuals with RA should use activity pacing, energy conservation, activity modification, and/or fatigue management. However, these interventions are generally safe and may help preserve physical function and manage fatigue. Proper instruction in these approaches by occupational or physical therapists (e.g., ensuring no prolonged inactivity) as well as periodic reminders to employ them were suggested by the Patient Panel and Voting Panel.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend use of assistive devices over no assistive devices.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend use of adaptive equipment over no adaptive equipment.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend use of environmental adaptations over no environmental adaptations.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In the absence of evidence addressing recommendations for the use of assistive devices, adaptive equipment, or environmental adaptations for RA patients, a conditional recommendation was made in favor of using assistive devices/equipment because of the potential for meaningfully improving the function and quality of life and the lack of known harms. The timing of the use of interventions, guidance on intervention selection, and education on how to use these interventions should be considered. Involving an occupational or physical therapist can aid these processes and ensure patient safety. The Voting Panel recognized cost and burden as barriers to the use of these interventions.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For patients who are currently employed or want to become employed, we conditionally recommend use of vocational rehabilitation (training programs to support employment) over no vocational rehabilitation.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For patients who are currently employed or want to become employed, we conditionally recommend work site evaluations and/or modifications over no work site evaluations and/or modifications.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In the absence of evidence to support use of vocational rehabilitation and low certainty evidence for use of work site evaluations and modifications, we conditionally recommend use of these approaches. The Voting Panel recognized that the following factors should be considered in implementing work site evaluations and modifications: 1) the employee/employer relationship regarding health-specific variables and confidentiality, 2) the patient's comfort with disclosure of RA to the employer, 3) the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Family and Medical Leave Act, 4) the heterogeneity of employer resources and employee job responsibilities, and 5) the variable availability of experienced work and ergonomics specialists.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Diet recommendations (Table 5)</ns0:head><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet over no formally defined diet.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The Mediterranean-style diet pattern emphasizes the intake of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, nuts, seeds, and olive oil and the intake of moderate amounts of low-fat dairy and fish, and limits the use of added sugars, sodium, highly processed foods, refined carbohydrates, and saturated fats. We conditionally recommend adherence to a Mediterranean-style diet based on low to moderate certainty of evidence of improvement in pain and no difference in physical function or disease activity. The recommendation is conditional because of the level of certainty of the evidence, patient preferences, and costs of, access to, and burden associated with this type of diet. The Voting Panel recognized the potential benefits of a Mediterranean-style diet for long-term health outcomes (e.g., longevity and cardiovascular disease) that are affected by RA disease activity and the evidence from studies in the general population</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend against adherence to a formally defined diet, other than a Mediterranean-style diet.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend against adherence to a formally defined diet, other than the Mediterranean-style diet, based on very low to moderate certainty evidence demonstrating no consistent, clinically meaningful benefit from following other formally defined diet strategies (other than a Mediterranean-style diet) on physical function, pain, or disease activity specific to RA (see Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ns0:ref>). In addition to the level of certainty of the evidence, this recommendation is conditional because of the burden and costs that accompany adhering to a formally defined diet, and patient preferences are expected to differ.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend following established dietary recommendations without use of dietary supplements over adding dietary supplements.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend following established dietary recommendations without the use of dietary supplements for RA management. This recommendation pertains to all dietary supplements considered (as listed in Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ns0:ref>) and is based on very low to moderate certainty evidence demonstrating no consistent, clinically meaningful benefit from adding dietary supplements with regard to physical function, pain, or disease activity specific to RA. The recommendation is conditional because of the level of certainty of the evidence, expected variation in patient preferences, adequacy of nutrient intake through diet, lack of regulation (e.g., by the US Food and Drug Administration), possibility of harm (e.g., interactions with medications, side effects), and costs. The Voting Panel supported a "food first" approach but recognized the role dietary supplements may serve for bone (e.g., vitamin D) and cardiovascular health (e.g., fish oil), which are particularly important in individuals with RA</ns0:p><ns0:p>Body weight and weight loss Given the broad spectrum of weight loss interventions, including lifestyle modification, commercial weight loss programs, pharmacologic therapies, and surgical interventions, the Voting Panel did not vote on recommendations regarding weight loss interventions specifically for RA management in overweight or obese people with RA. However, the Voting Panel was unanimous in its support of clinicians engaging in discussion about maintaining a healthy body weight for individuals with RA, in order to optimize long-term RA and general health outcomes. In RA, obesity is associated with higher disease activity, impairments in physical function, and poorer treatment response, in addition to poor long-term health outcomes</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Additional integrative intervention recommendations (Table 6)</ns0:head><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend use of a standardized self-management program over no standardized selfmanagement program.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend that RA patients use a standardized self-management program based on low certainty evidence to indicate that it results in improved physical function and pain. The Patient Panel described how these programs can be "life changing" and can provide motivation related to several factors that contribute to quality of life, including mental wellness and psychological adaptation to disease experience. The availability of and access to these programs as well as their costs were noted as potential barriers.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend use of cognitive behavioral therapy and/or mind-body approaches over no cognitive behavioral therapy and/or mind-body approaches.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend use of cognitive behavioral therapy and/or mind-body approaches based on very low to low certainty evidence indicating no consistent improvement in pain and physical function (critical outcomes) but low to moderate certainty evidence of improvement in depression, anxiety, fatigue, and sleep (important outcomes) when individuals with RA use these approaches. Although these interventions are beneficial for chronic disease management, access to experienced healthcare professionals, cost, and the burden of using these interventions were recognized barriers.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend use of acupuncture over no acupuncture.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend use of acupuncture based on low certainty evidence indicating inconsistent improvements in pain and function. The Patient Panel generally found acupuncture to be of lower value than other considered interventions for RA management based on their disease experiences. For individuals with RA, the burden, cost, access, and invasiveness of acupuncture may impact the choice to use this intervention.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend use of massage therapy over no massage therapy.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend use of massage therapy based on very low certainty evidence that it results in improvement of pain. Massage therapy intensity and technique may affect a patient's experience; therefore, it is best delivered by a provider (e.g., massage therapist, physical therapist) with knowledge of and experience in treating people with RA. Burden, cost, access, and short-term duration of benefit should be considered.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend use of thermal modalities over no thermal modalities.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend use of thermal modalities, such as cryotherapy, heat, and therapeutic ultrasound, based on very low certainty evidence indicating that it results in improvement in pain and physical function. Individuals with RA receive varying levels of benefit from thermal modalities, and patient preferences are expected to vary with regard to the choice of a thermal modality. Individuals with RA can control and administer many of these modalities at home, though others may benefit from guidance from an occupational or physical therapist.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend against use of electrotherapy.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend against use of electrotherapy modalities, such as transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) and neuro-muscular electrical nerve stimulation, for RA management, based on low certainty evidence indicating that there is no improvement of pain and physical function specific to RA with these modalities. While some individuals with RA may receive benefit from these interventions (e.g., in the setting of comprehensive PT or OT), the Voting Panel recommended against electrotherapy because the evidence was not felt to outweigh the burden and costs.</ns0:p><ns0:p>No recommendation was made by the Voting Panel on the use of vagus nerve stimulation, because this invasive procedure is not currently approved by the FDA as an intervention in RA.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We conditionally recommend against use of chiropractic therapy.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In the absence of evidence, we conditionally recommend against use of chiropractic therapy (i.e., chiropractic spinal adjustment) directly for the management of RA because of the potential cervical spine complications that can occur</ns0:p><ns0:p>Tobacco cessation Due to existing clinical quality measures for tobacco use screening and cessation</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>DISCUSSION</ns0:head><ns0:p>This is the first ACR guideline on the use of exercise, rehabilitation, diet, and additional integrative interventions in conjunction with DMARDs for RA management. This guideline highlights the importance of an interprofessional healthcare team to provide optimal care to individuals with RA. The recommended interventions do not replace DMARD treatments, in accordance with existing ACR pharmacologic treatment guidelines</ns0:p><ns0:p>The one strong recommendation was for consistent engagement in exercise. Recommendations for exercise include multiple types (aerobic, aquatic, resistance, mind-body), which is consistent with physical activity guidelines produced by the US Department of Health and Human Services .The specific type, frequency, intensity, and duration of exercise should be tailored to each person with the assistance of their clinicians, considering the potential burden on and capacity of each person</ns0:p><ns0:p>Several rehabilitation interventions as well as comprehensive OT and PT were recommended for their benefits on pain, physical function, preserving independence, remaining in work, and safety, although the certainty of evidence was low or very low. The Patient Panel consistently emphasized the importance of receiving interventions from occupational and/or physical therapists to ensure proper use and their desire for referrals to occupational and physical therapists earlier in the disease course. Early referral to these services can educate individuals with RA as to how to continue interventions independently (e.g., exercise, joint protection, energy conservation, assistive and adaptive devices) to self-manage their disease. Ensuring a sufficient workforce of occupational and physical therapists well-versed in the management of RA and access to this care are high priorities.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Dietary patterns and quality have been associated with RA risk and severity in many, though not all, epidemiologic studies</ns0:p><ns0:p>Additional integrative interventions that we conditionally recommended included standardized self-management programs, cognitive behavioral therapy and mind-body approaches, acupuncture, massage therapy, and thermal modalities. Although the evidence supporting these interventions was of very low to low certainty, these interventions possess few harms and a modest burden for many individuals with RA. The Patient Panel favored standardized selfmanagement, cognitive behavioral therapy, mind-body approaches, and thermal modalities because these interventions allowed them to better cope with the chronic disease aspects of RA and/or they offered a management option that could be controlled independently, often at home. Individuals with RA who currently use tobacco should be supported in their tobacco cessation journey. The limited efficacy of counseling on tobacco cessation</ns0:p><ns0:p>A broad range of interventions was considered in this guideline. It is unlikely that one clinician will possess the necessary expertise in all these areas, which illustrates the importance of assembling an interprofessional healthcare team to best support individuals with RA. The Patient Panel emphasized that rheumatology clinicians (e.g., physicians, physician assistants, nurse practitioners) are most often their first contact for therapeutic decisions. Thus, it was important to patients that their rheumatology clinician(s) be knowledgeable about integrative therapies and help guide patients to other professionals with relevant expertise (e.g., physical and occupational therapists, dieticians, clinical exercise physiologists, psychologists, massage therapists, acupuncturists) early in the disease course, so that they can be involved in shared-decision making throughout the disease course.</ns0:p><ns0:p>RA is a chronic disease that imposes considerable costs on those affected as well as increased costs to society</ns0:p><ns0:p>The majority of recommendations were conditional in part because of low certainty evidence. Several factors contributed to the low certainty grading, including the following: 1) the limited number of studies evaluating relevant interventions; 2) lack of blinding and study attrition; 3) small sample sizes resulting in imprecision; and 4) heterogeneity of study designs (e.g., various interventions [comprehensive therapy versus an individual component], comparators, and outcomes) that prevented pooling results through a formal meta-analysis. Many of these issues are inherent to research evaluating the considered interventions (e.g., exercise, diet). These conditional recommendations indicate that clinicians should engage in shared decision-making with patients when deciding whether to use these interventions. The low or very low certainty evidence supporting most recommendations calls for prioritizing research into these interventions and prompted a proposed research agenda (Table<ns0:ref type="table">7</ns0:ref>). Key items include determining the efficacy, safety, optimal timing, mode of delivery, and personalization of these interventions.</ns0:p><ns0:p>There are limitations to the development of these guidelines. Studies that were conducted prior to more recent treatment eras (characterized by early diagnosis of RA and a treat-to-target approach) were included in the evidence report and may be less generalizable than more recently completed studies. Although broad expertise was recruited and an extensive list of interventions was considered in this guideline, we could not ensure expertise in every area of integrative RA management or consider all possible integrative interventions. For example, members of the Patient Panel inquired about use of cannabinoids as an RA treatment, given the rising prevalence of their use in rheumatic diseases</ns0:p><ns0:p>Sciences University</ns0:p><ns0:p>In summary, this guideline outlines initial recommendations on the management of RA with exercise, rehabilitation, diet, and additional integrative interventions. These recommendations complement existing pharmacologic treatment guidelines that instruct on the use of DMARDs and, taken together, can guide a shared decision-making approach between the individual with RA and their clinician. Interprofessional treatment teams are crucial to implementing these recommendations. The generally low-quality evidence highlights the need for well-designed studies in the area of integrative management of RA. Policy efforts are needed to ensure access to recommended interventions for individuals with RA from diverse backgrounds and settings. Together, these integrative and pharmacologic guidelines support the comprehensive management of RA in pursuit of optimal outcomes for people living with RA.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:note place="foot" xml:id="foot_0"><ns0:p>21514658, 2023, 8, Downloaded from https://acrjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25117, Wiley Online Library on [13/12/2023].
