Up to 29-45% of patients with PMR do not adequately respond to GCs within 3-4 weeks. Relapses and long-term GC dependency are common</ns0:p><ns0:p>Primary objective of the recommendations. These recommendations are intended for the management of patients with PMR in various settings and are based on clinical evidence and expert opinion including informed patient decision-making.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Target population. The target population are patients with PMR based on clinician diagnosis which may be supported by currently available diagnostic or classification criteria</ns0:p><ns0:p>Target users. The target users of these recommendations are primary, secondary and tertiary care physicians (that is, general practitioners [GPs], specialists in general [internal] medicine and rheumatologists).</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Methods</ns0:head><ns0:p>For a detailed description of methods, see online supplementary file S1, on the Arthritis &amp; Rheumatology web site at<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/</ns0:ref>art.39333/abstract.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In brief, we used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology as a framework<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/</ns0:ref>doi/10.1002/art.39333/abstract], or the accompanying paper by Dejaco et al<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary">http://onlinelibrary</ns0:ref>. wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39333/abstract). Quality appraisal of interventional and prognostic studies was performed using GRADE<ns0:ref type="table">S1</ns0:ref>[<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39333/abstract">http:// onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39333/abstract</ns0:ref>] for details) on safety aspects related to the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), GCs and methotrexate (MTX) was taken into account as indirect evidence, in order to identify the optimal trade-off between the benefit and harm of interventions. Prognostic factors were used to build subgroups and to adapt the recommendations based on the presence or absence of unfavorable prognostic factors. Final recommendations were either "in favor" or "against" an intervention, and were graded as "conditional" or "strong." A strong recommendation in favor (against) was considered when the panel was certain that benefits did (did not) outweigh risks and burdens, the preferences/values of patients were met (not met) and resource use was reasonable (unreasonably high). If uncertainty existed, a conditional recommendation was made.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Results</ns0:head><ns0:p>The results of the SLR are reported in a separate manuscript<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary">http://onlinelibrary</ns0:ref>. wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.39333/abstract) for a summary of the SLR and external evidence considered by the guideline panel.</ns0:p><ns0:p>General aspects. These recommendations should be understood as clinical advice and do not dictate the care of a particular patient. The EULAR and ACR consider adherence to these recommendations to be voluntary, with the physician making the ultimate decision to apply them in light of each patient's individual circumstances.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Overarching principles for the management of PMR. The group agreed upon several principles deemed to be fundamental aspects of clinical care in PMR as detailed in Box 1. These principles have not directly resulted from the SLR, but are consensus based. They are intended as a framework for the implementation of Box 1. Summary of the 2015 European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommendations for the management of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) Target population: Patients with PMR based on clinician diagnosis which may be supported by currently available diagnostic or classification criteria</ns0:p><ns0:p>Overarching principles for the management of PMR: A. Adoption of a safe and specific approach to ascertain the PMR case definition. The clinical evaluation should be directed toward exclusion of relevant mimicking (eg, non-inflammatory, inflammatory (such as giant cell arteritis or rheumatoid arthritis), drug-induced, endocrine, infective and neoplastic) conditions. B. Every case of PMR should have the following assessments prior to the prescription of therapy (primary or secondary care):</ns0:p><ns0:p>" Documentation of a basic laboratory dataset. This will help to exclude mimicking conditions and establish a baseline for monitoring of therapy. This should include rheumatoid factor and/or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA), C-reactive protein and/or erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), blood count, glucose, creatinine, liver function tests, bone profile (including calcium, alkaline phosphatase) and dipstick urinalysis. Additional investigations to consider are protein electrophoresis, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), creatine kinase and vitamin D. " Depending on clinical signs and symptoms and the likelihood of the alternative diagnoses, additional more extensive serological tests such as anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA), anti-cytoplasmic neutrophil antibodies (ANCA) or tuberculosis tests may be performed to exclude mimicking conditions. Additional investigations such as chest radiographs may be considered at the discretion of the physician in order to exclude other diagnoses. " Determination of comorbidities (particularly hypertension, diabetes, glucose intolerance, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, peptic ulcer, osteoporosis [and particularly recent fractures]), presence of cataract or (risk factors for) glaucoma, presence of chronic or recurrent infections, and co-medication with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as outlined in Smolen et al</ns0:p><ns0:p>the specific treatment recommendations and are of a general "overarching" nature, a concept adapted from earlier EULAR recommendations</ns0:p><ns0:p>Specific recommendations. See Box 1 for a summary of the recommendations. A flow-chart for the management of PMR patients is depicted in Figure<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation 1: (PICO 1) The panel strongly recommends using GCs instead of NSAIDs in patients with PMR, with the exception of possible short-term use of NSAIDs and/or analgesics in PMR patients with pain related to other conditions (eg, co-existing osteoarthritis). No specific recommendation can be made for analgesics.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Explanation: The group recommends strongly against the use of NSAIDs compared to GCs in the treatment of PMR since the relative harm of long-term NSAID use (as mainly indicated by external evidence) outweighs the possible small benefits in PMR. No specific recommendation can be made for analgesics. On a basis of consensus, the panel recognized that the short-term use of NSAIDs and/or analgesics may be necessary in the setting of pain related to conditions other than PMR.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation 2: (PICO 2) The panel strongly recommends using the minimum effective individualized duration of GC therapy in PMR patients.</ns0:p><ns0:p>A more specific recommendation is not possible due to the lack of published evidence on this issue. On a basis of consensus and in accordance with the overarching principles, the group unanimously agreed to choose the minimum effective individualized duration and dose of GCs to balance benefit versus harm after assessing risk factors for GC-related adverse events, comorbidities, concomitant medications, relapses and prolonged therapy. Our recommended GC tapering schedule (see Recommendation 4) assumes a minimum of 12 months of treatment. A more specific statement is not possible because of the lack of PMR studies on this particular topic and because of the multiple subgroups and factors that need to be taken into account.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation 3: (PICOs 3-5) The panel conditionally recommends using the minimum effective GC dose within a range of 12.5-25 mg prednisone equivalent daily as the initial treatment of PMR. A higher initial prednisone dose within this range may be considered in patients with a high risk of relapse and low risk of adverse events, whereas in patients with relevant comorbidities (eg, diabetes, osteoporosis, glaucoma, etc.) and other risk factors for GC-related side effects, a lower dose may be preferred. The panel discourages conditionally the use of initial doses #7.5 mg/day and strongly recommends against the use of initial doses .30 mg/day.</ns0:p><ns0:p>According to the SLR on prognostic factors and based on clinical experience, the group agreed upon the existence of various PMR subgroups that are characterized by different risks of relapse, prolonged GC therapy and/or GC-related adverse events as well as by various comorbidities and co-medications. As there are insufficient data to make evidence-based recommendations for all conceivable subgroups, and taking current clinical practice into account</ns0:p><ns0:p>The group conditionally discourages low (#7.5 mg/ day) and strongly recommends against high (.30 mg/day prednisone equivalent) initial GC doses. For this statement the group extrapolated the data from randomized controlled trials</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation 4: (PICO 6) The panel strongly recommends individualizing dose-tapering schedules, based on regular monitoring of patient disease activity, laboratory markers and adverse events.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The following principles of GC dose tapering are suggested:</ns0:p><ns0:p>A. Initial tapering: Taper dose to an oral dose of 10 mg/day prednisone equivalent within 4-8 weeks. B. Relapse therapy: Increase oral prednisone to the pre-relapse dose and decrease it gradually (within 4-8 weeks) to the dose at which the relapse occurred. C. Tapering once remission is achieved (following initial and relapse therapies): Taper daily oral prednisone by 1 mg every 4 weeks (or by 1.25 mg decrements using schedules such as 10/7.5 mg on alternate days, etc.) until discontinuation as long as remission is maintained.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In accordance with the overarching principles, the panel agreed upon a strong recommendation to 2574 DEJACO ET AL individualize dose tapering and to regularly monitor PMR patients. Further, the panel proposed general principles for initial and post-relapse tapering of GCs (based on consensus and current clinical practice) but did not fix a schedule as in other guidelines</ns0:p><ns0:p>The group suggested prednisone should be tapered by 1 mg/4 weeks or similar once remission is achieved. Again, the panel emphasized the important overall principle of gradual GC reduction without the need to prescribe a fixed schedule. The group further recognized that 1 mg prednisone tablets are not available in all countries (making a reduction of 1 mg/4 weeks unfeasible) and that other regimens such as alternate day reductions (eg, 10/7.5 mg on alternate days, etc.) are common clinical practice</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation 5: (PICO 7) The panel conditionally recommends considering intramuscular (i.m.) methylprednisolone as an alternative to oral GCs. The choice between oral GCs and i.m. methylprednisolone remains at the discretion of the treating physician.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In one clinical trial, i.m. methylprednisolone was applied at a dose of 120 mg every 3 weeks until week 9. At week 12, 100 mg were used and subsequently, injections were continued at monthly intervals and the dose was reduced by 20 mg every 12 weeks until week 48. Thereafter, the dose was reduced by 20 mg every 16 weeks until discontinuation</ns0:p><ns0:p>The panel did not specify a clinical phenotype where i.m. GCs would be appropriate or adequate therapy; however, the panel agreed that in clinical practice this preparation may be considered in cases where a lower cumulative GC dose is desirable, for example in female patients with difficult to control hypertension, diabetes, osteoporosis and/or glaucoma</ns0:p><ns0:p>The reasons why the panel did not endorse a strong recommendation for the use of i.m. methylprednisolone are the following: 1) the efficacy of i.m. methylprednisolone is supported by a single randomized controlled trial and confirmation of these data is still necessary</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation 6: (PICO 8) The panel conditionally recommends using a single rather than divided daily doses of oral GCs for the treatment of PMR, except for special situations such as prominent night pain while tapering GCs below the low-dose range (prednisone or equivalent ,5 mg daily).</ns0:p><ns0:p>There are no studies available addressing this issue specifically in PMR. Based on clinical experience and because of the concern that adverse events (including disturbance of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis) may be higher with divided doses, the group agreed against the general use of divided GC doses in PMR</ns0:p><ns0:p>In special situations such as in case of night pain while tapering below the low-dose range (prednisone or equivalent ,5 mg daily), split doses may be considered. However, persistent breakthrough symptoms should prompt re-consideration of the diagnosis.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation 7: (PICO 9) The panel conditionally recommends considering early introduction of MTX in addition to GCs, particularly in patients at high risk of relapse and/or prolonged therapy as well as in cases with risk factors, comorbidities and/or concomitant medications where GC-related adverse events are more likely to occur. MTX may also be considered during follow-up in patients with a relapse, without a significant response to GC or experiencing GC-related adverse events.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In clinical trials, MTX has been used at oral doses of 7.5-10 mg/week</ns0:p><ns0:p>Similar to the explanation of Recommendation 5, the panel felt that there is no clinical prototype unconditionally warranting treatment with MTX, rather the use of this drug should be discussed on an individual basis. In clinical practice, MTX may be considered for example in female patients</ns0:p><ns0:p>The panel also reached a consensus that MTX should be considered in patients who have relapsed (either on or off GCs), cases without significant response to GC or patients experiencing GC-related adverse events. The group further agreed that MTX may be used with oral or i.m. GC preparations even if the concomitant use of MTX and i.m. methylprednisolone has not been tested formally.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The efficacy of MTX was addressed in four randomized controlled trials and one retrospective study testing the use of MTX plus oral GCs (initial prednisone doses ranging from 15 to 25 mg/day)</ns0:p><ns0:p>The reasons why the panel did not support a stronger recommendation for the use of MTX in PMR are the following: 1) the total number of patients investigated in randomized trials was small (n5194)</ns0:p><ns0:p>The group recognized that no recommendation can be made for the use of other non-biologic (ie, conventional synthetic and conventional targeted) DMARDs in PMR because of the lack of good evidence from PMR studies. Hydroxychloroquine was investigated by a single very low QoE retrospective study reporting no benefit regarding relapse rate</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation 8: (PICOs 10-11) The panel strongly recommends against the use of TNFa blocking agents for the treatment of PMR.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The group agreed strongly against the use of TNFa blocking agents in PMR at this time since there is no evidence for benefit, but there is a considerable risk of potential harm and high resource use</ns0:p><ns0:p>No recommendation can be made for other biologic agents as no prospective trials have been published so far. There is one ongoing randomized study on the The group agreed that future studies in polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) should be multicenter and properly powered using an agreed, validated core outcome set and a robust trial design that would maximize the power of studies, facilitate regulatory approvals and allow future meta-analysis. Specific research questions: 1. Which outcome measures including patient-related outcomes, and response, remission and relapse criteria should be used in PMR? What is the value of a composite score? What are the most relevant treatment targets in PMR? 2. What is the efficacy and safety of different routes of glucocorticoid (GC) administration (oral, intramuscular, intra-articular), different initial GC doses, various GC tapering regimens, and different GC flare doses? 3. What is the efficacy and safety of DMARDs (non-TNFa biologic, conventional synthetic and conventional targeted) in PMR? What is the optimal strategy for using DMARDs in PMR: monotherapy versus combination therapy, early versus late introduction, and (particularly for biologics) use with or without GCs? 4. What is the minimal/optimal duration of therapy and which strategies for withdrawing GCs and/or DMARDs yield the best efficacy/safety profile? 5. What is the optimal strategy for shared primary and specialty care including recommendations for specialist referral? How can patients be better involved in treatment decisions, and are there any decision aids? What is the role of self-management? 6. What is the value of tight control (ie, treat to target) versus conventional management strategies in PMR? 7. How should patients with long-standing disease and long-term low-dose GC therapy be managed? 8. What is the cost utility and effectiveness of DMARD use in PMR (versus GC use alone)? 9. What is the value of non-pharmacological therapies in PMR? Particularly, it is assumed but not yet demonstrated that physiotherapy may support preservation of function and reduce the risk of adverse events related to GC use. Patients may benefit from exercise by maintaining muscle mass and function as well as by fall prevention especially in the frail. What is the role of diet in PMR and nutrition supplements (eg, fish oil) related to outcomes? 10. What is the efficacy and safety of herbal preparations in PMR? 11. What is the role of imaging (particularly ultrasound) for the assessment and monitoring of PMR, identification of overlap with other diseases (eg, large vessel vasculitis or inflammatory arthritis) alongside clinical and patient reported outcomes? 12. Which biomarkers may be useful in PMR? Why do some patients do better than others? How can we identify these groups and what is the biological mechanism behind it? Should different drugs be applied to different PMR subgroups? 13. What is the morbidity and mortality of PMR patients (with a particular focus on cardiovascular risk) in long-term observational studies? There are no studies investigating the value of non-pharmacological therapies (eg, physiotherapy, relaxation techniques, diets, etc.) in PMR and there is insufficient clinical experience on this issue to agree on a specific recommendation. Nevertheless, the panel agreed on recommending an individualized exercise program (see overarching principles) in view of its benefit for maintaining muscle mass and function and reducing risk of falls, especially in older persons on long-term GCs as well as in frail patients.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Use of herbal preparations in PMR. The panel strongly recommends against the use of the Chinese herbal preparations Yanghe and Biqi capsules in PMR patients.</ns0:p><ns0:p>There were some discussions about whether herbal preparations could be considered non-pharmacological interventions (and were therefore within the scope of PICO 12); however, the panel felt the need for comment on this issue because several preparations are available which may be popular with PMR patients.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The SLR identified two studies testing Chinese Yanghe herb decoction and Chinese Biqi capsules in PMR patients</ns0:p><ns0:p>The group nevertheless agreed (after balancing evidence, benefit/harm, availability and resource use) to recommend strongly against the regular use of these preparations at this time for the following reasons: 1) the relevance of the small effect of Chinese Yanghe herb decoction on ESR is minimal for patients and good evidence for a clinical benefit of the substance is not available; 2) neither of the two substances is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the European Medicines Agency (EMA); 3) the generalizability of the evidence for benefit is unclear; 4) these preparations may have unforeseeable adverse effects; 5) the availability of high quality preparations is unclear; and 6) resource impact (ie, costs) is unknown.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Release and implementation of the recommendations.

The 2015 EULAR/ACR recommendations for the management of PMR is the first collaborative project between EULAR and ACR to endorse treatment recommendations in rheumatology.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We recognize that our recommendations are only partially supported by evidence, and that they do not cover all aspects important for the management of PMR. The group therefore unanimously agreed that the research agenda (containing the evidence gaps related to PMR management) is an important result of this project (Box 2).</ns0:p><ns0:p>Due to our rigorous SLR approach to select high quality papers, we did not include other reviews, case reports or case series indicating possible treatment options in treatment-resistant PMR patients.
