		<ns0:body><ns0:div><ns0:head>INTRODUCTION</ns0:head><ns0:p>Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is characterized by inflammation and/or fibrosis of the lung parenchyma and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in people with systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases (SARDs). Although people with SARDs are at risk for developing ILD in general, those with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic sclerosis (SSc), idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIM; including polymyositis, dermatomyositis, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy, and anti-synthetase syndrome), mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD), and Sjögren disease (SjD) are at particularly high risk.<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p><ns0:p>There are no existing guidelines for ILD screening for people with SARDs. This guideline was developed to provide recommendations for the screening of ILD in people with SARDs (RA, SSc, IIM, MCTD, and SjD) at greatest risk of ILD and for monitoring for ILD progression. These recommendations will facilitate rheumatologists' identification of people with SARDs who have ILD and assist in optimizing the co-management of people with SARDassociated ILD by rheumatologists and pulmonologists.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>METHODS</ns0:head><ns0:p>This guideline was developed following the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) guideline development process and ACR policy guiding management of conflicts of interest and disclosures (<ns0:ref type="url" target="https://rheumatology.org/clinical-practice-guidelines">https:// rheumatology.org/clinical-practice-guidelines</ns0:ref>), which includes Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Of note is the rating of evidence for surrogate outcomes. Consistent with GRADE guidance, we defined surrogate outcomes as those that would not lead patients to accept a test that was also associated with burdens or harms if they were the only outcomes to improve.</ns0:p><ns0:p>As per ACR policy, consensus required ≥70% agreement on both the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of each recommendation. A recommendation could be either in favor of or against the proposed intervention and either strong or conditional. According to GRADE, a recommendation is categorized as strong if the panel is very confident that the benefits of an intervention clearly outweigh the harms (or vice versa); a conditional recommendation denotes uncertainty regarding the balance of benefits and harms, such as when the evidence certainty is low or very low, or when the decision is sensitive to individual patient preferences, or when costs are expected to impact the decision. Thus, conditional recommendations refer to decisions in which incorporation of patient preferences is a particularly essential element of decision-making.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Scope</ns0:head><ns0:p>Patients. This guideline applies to people with SARDs with high risk of ILD, specifically RA, SSc, IIM, MCTD, and SjD. This guideline does not include recommendations for pediatric SARDs (juvenile SSc, juvenile dermatomyositis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis) or people with sarcoidosis, interstitial pneumonia with autoimmune features (IPAF), undifferentiated connective tissue disease, ankylosing spondylitis, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or unclassifiable ILD. There was a need to limit the guideline scope, so the five diseases in which ILD occurs most frequently were prioritized. IPAF was not included because it is a research classification rather than a clinical diagnosis. Also, this guideline was not developed to guide evaluation for SARDs in patients with newly diagnosed ILD without a prior recognized SARD.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Interventions. The panel considered the following diagnostic and screening interventions: history and physical examination alone (including assessment of dyspnea, functional class,  Diffuse cutaneous subtype, male sex, African American race</ns0:p><ns0:p>• High-titer rheumatoid factor, high-titer anti-CCP</ns0:p><ns0:p>cough, and fatigue on history; tachypnea, cyanosis, and percussion for altered lung resonance and auscultation for crackles on physical examination), pulmonary function tests (PFTs; including spirometry, lung volumes, and diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide [DLCO]), high-resolution computed tomography of the chest (HRCT chest), 6-minute walk test distance (6MWD), chest radiography, ambulatory desaturation testing, bronchoscopy (bronchoalveolar lavage, transbronchial biopsy, and/or cryobiopsy), and surgical lung biopsy. This guideline does not make recommendations on education, self-monitoring of oxygen saturation, testing for supplemental oxygen requirement, or patient-reported outcomes, including questionnaires, eg, Chronic Respiratory Questionnaire, St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire, Mahler Dyspnea Index, University of California, San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire, Leicester Cough Questionnaire, Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Dyspnea, Modified Medical Research Council, and King's Brief Interstitial Lung Disease.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Outcomes. For screening recommendations, critical outcomes included disease-related outcomes (eg, progression of ILD), diagnostic accuracy as a surrogate for disease-related outcomes, and diagnostic testing-related adverse events. For monitoring recommendations, critical outcomes were disease-related outcomes, responsiveness/sensitivity to change of the test as a surrogate for disease-related outcomes, and testing-related adverse events.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>RESULTS/RECOMMENDATIONS</ns0:head><ns0:p>Based on 24 PICO questions, the panel developed 15 screening and monitoring recommendations (Tables<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_4">2</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_6">4</ns0:ref><ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_7">5</ns0:ref>). The literature search identified 5,235 records for the full set of PICO questions covering screening, monitoring, and treatment (the latter reported in separate treatment guidelines).</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Screening for SARD-ILD</ns0:head><ns0:p>Who should be screened. It was recognized that RA, SSc, IIM, MCTD, and SjD all confer an increased risk of ILD development compared to the general population. However, it was also recognized that the risks of ILD development and progression vary among and within these diseases. For example, people with RA have low frequency (ie, 3%-5% of people with RA) of progressive ILD, and a larger proportion have asymptomatic or stable disease. SSc confers a higher risk of ILD compared with other SARDs, but a subset of people with long-standing limited cutaneous SSc can have mild, stable ILD. Patients with RA-ILD with high-titer anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) or rheumatoid factor positivity, patients with SSc-ILD with early diffuse cutaneous disease and/or Scl-70 positivity, and patients with IIM-ILD with anti-melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (anti-MDA-5), anti-synthetase, or overlap antibodies (eg, PM-Scl, Ku, Ro52) are at increased risk for ILD progression. Thus, screening must be tailored to an individual patient, recognizing the need for shared decision-making. Although most people with SSc and many people with IIM warrant screening, it is not necessary to screen all people with RA or SjD. The Voting Panel voted on recommendations for people at higher risk of ILD within each disease. Although defining the magnitude of risk within diseases was beyond the scope of this guideline, Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ns0:ref>summarizes risk factors for ILD across diseases, identified by review of the literature, to inform clinicians of people who may warrant heightened screening and monitoring for ILD. Screening for ILD should not be limited to those with just these risk factors. The Patient Panel expressed a preference for identifying ILD early, even if there was a risk for identifying either subclinical disease that might not progress or incidental findings requiring additional testing. If there is uncertainty regarding whom to screen, clinicians should proceed with screening for ILD. Figure<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ns0:ref>summarizes tests suggested for screening at presentation. Figure<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ns0:ref>summarizes tests that are not recommended, along with examples of situations in which these tests may be useful.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend screening with PFTs over history and physical examination or ambulatory desaturation testing alone.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Given the poor diagnostic accuracy of history (dry cough: 15% sensitive, 89% specific) and examination (dry "velcro" crackles: 69% sensitive, 66% specific), despite very low certainty of evidence (one observational study),</ns0:p><ns0:p>For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend screening with HRCT chest over history and physical examination or PFTs alone.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Very low-certainty evidence suggests that the HRCT chest has a sensitivity of 95.7% and specificity of 63.8% for the detection of ILD (≥20% extent of lung involvement).</ns0:p><ns0:p>Low-certainty evidence from five observational studies suggests that PFTs alone may be insufficient to detect ILD among patients with newly diagnosed SARDs.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with chest radiography.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Three studies indicated a low sensitivity of chest radiography (58%-64%), limiting utility as a screening test for ILD.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with 6MWD.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The Literature Review Team found no published evidence regarding 6MWD as a screening test for ILD. Rather, it is used for evaluation for lung transplantation and for monitoring in those with pulmonary hypertension. In people with SARDs, the 6MWD can be impacted by other SARD manifestations that affect mobility including arthritis and cardiac disease. The Patient Panel felt the 6MWD frequently did not reflect symptoms and may not reflect functional status or ability to perform activities of daily living.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with ambulatory desaturation testing.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The Literature Review Team found no published evidence regarding the use of ambulatory desaturation testing as a screening test for ILD in SARDs. Given feasibility concerns in rheumatology outpatient practices, routine ambulatory desaturation testing was not recommended as a screening test. Within pulmonary outpatient practices and/or interdisciplinary models of shared care, ambulatory desaturation testing is more feasible and can be more easily offered in selected patients such as those with inadequate PFT quality, those who are unable to perform PFTs, or those with associated pulmonary hypertension.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For people with SARDs at increased risk of developing ILD, we conditionally recommend against screening with bronchoscopy.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Based on very low-certainty evidence from two observational studies,</ns0:p><ns0:p>One retrospective observational (very low-certainty evidence) study provided indirect evidence for this recommendation.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Suggestions for frequency of screening</ns0:head><ns0:p>Evidence to support the frequency of testing was limited,</ns0:p><ns0:p>The Core Team and Voting Panel preferred a risk-based approach. We suggest that most people with SSc, IIM, and MCTD with SSc features should have ILD screening tests at presentation. We also suggest that people with IIM have myositis-specific antibody testing to screen for the presence of high-risk ILD-associated antibodies (anti-synthetase and anti-MDA-5 antibodies). Although we do not suggest that all patients with RA and SjD be screened for ILD, we suggest screening at presentation in those with ILD risk factors such as those specified in, but not limited to, Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_1">1</ns0:ref>. We suggest that people with SARDs and associated greater risk of ILD be considered for rescreening with PFTs annually based on the presence of risk factors, and consideration for more frequent screening early in the patient's disease course should be based on specific high-risk autoantibody presence (eg, anti-Scl-70, anti-MDA-5, and anti-synthetase antibodies) or the development of ILD symptoms.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Monitoring for ILD progression</ns0:head><ns0:p>Although screening for ILD in people with SARDs is largely the purview of rheumatologists, the monitoring of patients with identified SARD-associated ILD is expected to be a multidisciplinary collaboration between rheumatology and pulmonology. Thus, some recommendations will comment on potential variations in practice between these specialties.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend monitoring with PFTs.</ns0:p><ns0:p>PFTs (spirometry, volumes, and DLCO) provide objective data that are helpful in following patients over time.

Concerns were raised about accurate oxygen saturation measurement in patients with Raynaud phenomenon, particularly those with SSc, because of poor finger perfusion. Thus, an ear or forehead oxygen saturation monitor is preferable in these circumstances.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend against monitoring with chest radiography.</ns0:p><ns0:p>One case-control study demonstrated a low sensitivity (64.0%) and moderate specificity (73.6%) of chest radiography relative to HRCT chest for identifying ILD among patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend against monitoring with 6MWD.</ns0:p><ns0:p>There was no evidence to support or oppose using 6MWD in the monitoring of people with SARD-ILD. 6MWD can be impacted by other health factors, such as arthritis and cardiac disease. Patients reported that 6MWD often did not reflect activities of daily living or function in daily life. If patients without confounding health factors can perform the test, it can be a useful marker to follow disease progression. 6MWD is important in the monitoring of patients pre-lung transplantation, those with pulmonary hypertension, and those unable to perform PFTs. For people with SARD-ILD, we conditionally recommend against monitoring with bronchoscopy.</ns0:p><ns0:p>There was no published evidence. The panel was not in favor of routine use of bronchoscopy for monitoring but recognized its utility in certain circumstances, such as in the evaluation of infection or alveolar hemorrhage.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Suggestions for frequency of monitoring</ns0:head><ns0:p>The Voting Panel decided not to provide firm recommendations for frequency of monitoring once an ILD diagnosis is made, but general guidance in the form of suggestions instead. Some patients may need more frequent monitoring, especially if symptoms change, and these suggestions should not be used to inform reimbursement decisions. There is substantial clinical variation from patient to patient that may affect testing frequency.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For people with IIM-ILD and SSc-ILD, we suggest PFTs for monitoring every 3 to 6 months for the first year, then less frequently once stable.</ns0:p><ns0:p>More frequent monitoring is needed early in the course of disease and in patients with active or progressive disease, and then every 6 to 12 months after the first year if the disease is stable. For people with long-standing SSc or IIM and prolonged stability of their ILD, we suggest less frequent monitoring. This range allows for flexibility.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For people with RA-ILD, SjD-ILD, and MCTD-ILD, we suggest PFTs for monitoring every 3 to 12 months for the first year, then less frequently once stable.</ns0:p><ns0:p>RA-ILD typically progresses more slowly than the other SARDs; however, a usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern confers a worse prognosis and may warrant more frequent monitoring. Monitoring those with RA-ILD with PFTs every 6 to 12 months is suggested, recognizing that specific situations may warrant more frequent monitoring (3-6 months). SjD-ILD tends to be milder than other types of SARD-associated ILD; however, those with the Ro52 antibody can progress quickly. SjD can occur as an overlap condition with anti-synthetase syndrome, SSc, and RA. More frequent monitoring, based on physician judgment, should be performed in patients with symptom worsening, a UIP pattern, presence of autoantibodies associated with rapidly progressive disease (eg, anti-MDA-5), and worsening PFTs. People with MCTD and prominent features of SSc or IIM may benefit from more frequent monitoring.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For people with SARD-ILD, we do not provide guidance about frequency of routine HRCT chest for monitoring ILD but suggest HRCT chest when clinically indicated.</ns0:p><ns0:p>There was hesitancy to recommend how frequently HRCT chest should be performed. HRCT chest is a complementary test to PFTs for the monitoring of ILD progression and may be specifically useful in cases in which coughing or other factors might affect PFT performance or interpretation, when changes in symptoms or PFT results lead to uncertainty about whether there has been ILD progression, when there is concern for infection or malignancy, or when assessing treatment response.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For people with SARD-ILD, we suggest monitoring for ambulatory desaturation every 3 to 12 months.</ns0:p><ns0:p>There was a discrepancy between the application of this clinical assessment by rheumatologists and pulmonologists. Testing for ambulatory desaturation is inexpensive and informs a patient's need for supplemental oxygen. However, evaluation of ambulatory desaturation is not routine practice for many rheumatologists, and there may be operational challenges in performing ambulatory desaturation testing in some rheumatology offices. Pulmonologists on the panel routinely perform ambulatory desaturation testing in their offices. It is difficult to recommend a specific interval of ambulatory desaturation testing, and there is no evidence to support this guidance.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>DISCUSSION</ns0:head><ns0:p>This guideline provides recommendations to clinicians for ILD screening and monitoring in people with RA, SSc, IIM, MCTD, and SjD. PFTs (including spirometry, lung volumes, and DLCO) and HRCT chest are conditionally recommended for the screening of ILD in people with these SARDs, whereas PFTs, HRCT chest, and ambulatory desaturation testing are conditionally recommended for the monitoring of people with SARD-ILD. There are limited to no roles for chest radiography, 6MWD, bronchoscopy, or surgical lung biopsy for the routine screening or monitoring of people with SARD-ILD. We provide guidance on the risk factors and frequency of testing to evaluate for the development of ILD in people with SARDs.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The risk of ILD varies among people with an established diagnosis of an SARD. Screening tests should not be applied routinely to all people with SARDs. Rather, screening should be focused on people with an SARD of interest who have an increased risk of developing ILD. We summarize published risk factors as a guide, but clinicians are not limited to just these risk factors. We acknowledge that, in some cases, screening may identify mild, asymptomatic ILD that is not progressive. The high morbidity of ILD once symptomatic, emergence of more effective treatments, and general preference of the Patient Panel for screening to identify ILD early contributed to our recommendations. Screening may be initiated through shared discussion with the patient. Screening for ILD will typically be initiated by rheumatologists because people with SARDs usually do not see a pulmonologist until after a diagnosis of ILD.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Frequency of testing was also discussed. Guidance on the frequency of testing across diseases was provided to support guideline implementation. This guidance on testing frequency is not based on evidence but rather expert opinion and patient preferences. Patients with a highly active underlying SARD warrant more frequent monitoring. Pulmonologists generally see more progressive than long-standing, stable disease and prefer more frequent monitoring. Similarly, the Patient Panel expressed that there is "nothing worse than being missed" and strongly preferred more frequent testing to be reassured that their disease is stable. Because the guideline's target population included people with SARDs who have stable ILD as well as those with progressive ILD, it was important to provide a wide and flexible range for frequency of testing that could be tailored to patients' needs. Because the guidance on frequency was based on expert opinion and patient preferences rather than evidence, we aimed for uniformity in our recommendations across diseases to ease implementation. We recognize that the frequency of monitoring will vary based on individual disease presentation and shared decision-making with each patient.</ns0:p><ns0:p>It was challenging for this group to reach consensus on the recommendation for ambulatory oxygen desaturation testing and the frequency of this testing. In people with Raynaud phenomenon, oxygen desaturation testing using a finger probe may not be accurate and, thus, may lead to the inappropriate prescription of supplemental oxygen. In such cases, ear or forehead probes offer potential for greater accuracy. Furthermore, although oxygen desaturation testing is routine practice for pulmonologists, implementation by rheumatologists may be challenging because of logistical considerations, highlighting one of many benefits of collaborative management between rheumatology and pulmonology for patients with SARD-ILD. It was clear that patients value and prefer collaboration and communication among their specialists.</ns0:p><ns0:p>These guidelines are limited by the low certainty of evidence available for review. Most of the questions addressed were supported by small-scale observational studies. In some cases, the evidence was indirect, indicating that the populations and/or interventions investigated in the included studies deviated from those intended for specific questions. Additionally, we did not have any available evidence to examine the relationship between frequency of screening or monitoring and subsequent outcomes. Furthermore, there was a lack of evidence regarding the effects of screening or monitoring on specific subpopulations, such as racial and ethnic minority groups. Finally, we were unable to include other important affected patient groups because the scope of the guideline focused on diseases associated with higher risk of developing ILD. Pediatric patient guidelines were not included given the existing Childhood Interstitial Lung Disease treatment guidance. SLE was not included in this guideline because the treatment of lung involvement most often aligns with treatment of the underlying SLE.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:note place="foot" xml:id="foot_0"><ns0:p>23265205, 2024, 8, Downloaded from https://acrjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.42860, Wiley Online Library on [02/08/2024].
