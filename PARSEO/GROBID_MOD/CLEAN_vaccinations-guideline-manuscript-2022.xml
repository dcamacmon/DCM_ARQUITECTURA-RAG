According to GRADE, a recommendation is categorized as strong if the panel is very confident that the benefits of an intervention clearly outweigh the harms (or vice versa); a conditional recommendation denotes uncertainty regarding the balance of benefits and harms, such as when the evidence quality is low or very low, or when costs are expected to impact the decision. Thus, for conditional recommendations, incorporation of patient preferences is particularly essential, acknowledging that patient preferences are an important part of all clinical decision-making.

The results were similar for other vaccinations, although the quality of the evidence was low. Strong concerns, however, were expressed among the Patient Panel about the potential for vaccines to cause a disease flare, and shared decision-making is particularly important in this setting. Most studies suggest that increased disease activity does not impact vaccine immunogenicity</ns0:p><ns0:p>Managing immunosuppressive therapy at the time of live attenuated vaccination to avoid vaccine-associated illness (Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p><ns0:p>For patients with RMD who are taking immunosuppressive medication, deferring live attenuated vaccines is conditionally recommended.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For patients with RMD, holding immunosuppressive medication for an appropriate period before and 4 weeks after live attenuated virus vaccination is conditionally recommended.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For some live attenuated virus vaccines, such as for oral polio, oral typhoid, and influenza, there are inactivated alternatives that can be safely given to RMD patients taking immunosuppressive medication.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Conventional DMARDs.

Cutaneous vaccine-strain varicella infection developed in 1 of 55 RA patients given a single dose of the live attenuated VZV vaccine 2-3 weeks prior to tofacitinib initiation in the context of an RCT.

Although the evidence around the safety of conventional DMARDs and TNFi at the time of live attenuated virus vaccination is reassuring, the total number of RMD patients who have been studied is small, and the Voting Panel conditionally recommended against administering live attenuated virus vaccines to patients receiving those agents as well as other forms of immunosuppression. For patients who do need to receive live attenuated vaccines, specific recommendations for holding immunosuppressive medications around the time of vaccination can be found in Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ns0:ref>.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For slow-acting conventional DMARDs, a prevaccination hold time of 4 weeks was chosen to reflect their prolonged duration of action. However, direct evidence for the optimal hold time is lacking.

However, very young children, especially those with autoinflammatory disorders, may require biologic DMARDs before their primary vaccination series is complete.

Rotavirus is rare in the US because of widespread immunization, and for this reason, the AAP recommends delaying rotavirus vaccination for 12 months after any in utero exposure to biologic DMARDs (except for certolizumab, which does not cross the placenta)</ns0:p><ns0:p>The literature review identified no data on the effect of in utero rituximab exposure on later vaccine responses. Rituximab is a chimeric IgG1 molecule that can cross the placenta, and it has been associated with low or absent B lymphocyte levels in newborns who were exposed during the second or third (but not the first) trimester</ns0:p><ns0:p>After giving birth, most RMD patients turn to their general pediatrician rather than to their adult rheumatology provider for infant vaccination recommendations, and pediatricians may not be aware of the impact of in utero medication exposure on vaccine safety and immunogenicity. Therefore, recommendations regarding infant rotavirus vaccination after in utero exposure to either TNFi or rituximab should be discussed with the pregnant RMD patient prior to delivery. Specifically, the pregnant patient should be educated as to the fact that medications that cross the placenta may affect vaccination schedules for their infants.

An underlying principle in this guideline is that patients should be vaccinated, and that missed vaccination opportunities should be avoided or minimized. This is particularly true regarding influenza vaccination, which is administered seasonally and is recommended for RMD patients even if their disease activity is high, they are taking high-dose glucocorticoids, and/or are taking rituximab. The Voting Panel generally favored simple recommendations to encourage vaccination and foster guideline adherence. There are few studies assessing the immunogenicity and safety of specific vaccines in relation to specific immunosuppressive medications, and there are virtually no studies assessing the impact of holding medications around the time of vaccination, particularly for vaccines other than for influenza. Therefore, many of the recommendations are conditional and apply across diseases, vaccines, medications, and age groups. Because of the low quality of the evidence, shared decision-making between clinicians and patients/parents/guardians is particularly important for the vaccination strategies presented here. These recommendations do not supersede clinical judgement.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Most recommendations in this guideline are aimed at maximizing vaccine immunogenicity because the literature revealed few vaccine safety signals, at least regarding non-live vaccinations. Many vaccines are required for school entry to protect not only the health of the individual but also that of the broader community. Public health requirements may supersede some recommendations made here. Insurance barriers could inhibit implementation of these recommendations, such as to administer high dose or adjuvanted influenza vaccine or recombinant VZV to RMD patients &lt;65 years of age taking immunosuppressive medications. In such instances, this guideline could be used as a resource to aid in prior authorization.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Not included in this guideline are recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination in patients with RMD. Readers can refer to the CDC for the most up-to-date recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination, including for patients taking immunosuppressive   medication<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ns0:ref>) differ from those recommended around the time of COVID-19 vaccination in the ACR COVID-19 vaccine guidance</ns0:p><ns0:p>Finally, the literature review demonstrated that much more evidence is needed to guide practice in this area. Knowledge gaps where further research is needed are as follows: 1) standardization of trial design and outcome measures to test the efficacy and durability of response to all vaccines across all age groups; 2) safety of primary and booster live attenuated virus vaccination in children taking methotrexate and/or biologic DMARDs; 3) assessment of the immunogenicity, reactogenicity, and disease flares following standard-dose, high-dose, and adjuvanted influenza vaccination, recombinant VZV vaccination, and primary and booster COVID-19 vaccination in RMD patients taking immunosuppressive medication; and 4) RCTs to test the safety and efficacy of holding DMARDs around the time of vaccination.  † The terms 'moderate', 'low', and 'very low' are based on the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) definitions for quality of evidence. Moderate quality means that "further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate." Low quality means that "further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate." Very low quality means that "we are very uncertain about the estimate." In the systematic review for this guideline, a judgment of moderate quality required at least some evidence from randomized controlled trials, and a judgment of low quality required at least some evidence from well-designed observational studies with appropriate comparator groups. ‡ Indirect evidence indicates that there is evidence from other populations with RMD or other health conditions, or evidence that does not fully address the comparison specified in a PICO question.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:note place="foot" xml:id="foot_0"><ns0:p>21514658, 2023, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.25045, Wiley Online Library on [24/02/2023].
