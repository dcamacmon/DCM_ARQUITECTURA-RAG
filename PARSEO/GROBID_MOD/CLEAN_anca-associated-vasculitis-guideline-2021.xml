		<ns0:body><ns0:div><ns0:head>INTRODUCTION</ns0:head><ns0:p>The antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) comprise granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). These diseases affect smalland medium-sized vessels and are characterized by multisystem organ involvement.</ns0:p><ns0:p>GPA is characterized histologically by necrotizing granulomatous inflammation in addition to vasculitis. Common clinical manifestations include destructive sinonasal lesions, pulmonary nodules, and pauci-immune glomerulonephritis. GPA is most commonly associated with cytoplasmic ANCA and antibodies to proteinase 3 (PR3). Among European populations, prevalence ranges from 24 to 157 cases per million, with the highest prevalence reported in Sweden and the UK</ns0:p><ns0:p>MPA is characterized histologically by vasculitis without granulomatous inflammation. Common clinical manifestations include rapidly progressive pauci-immune glomerulonephritis and alveolar hemorrhage. MPA is most commonly associated with perinuclear ANCA and antibodies to myeloperoxidase. The prevalence of MPA ranges from 0 to 66 cases per million among European countries and 86 cases per million in Japan</ns0:p><ns0:p>EGPA is characterized histologically by eosinophilic tissue infiltration in addition to vasculitis. Common clinical manifestations include asthma, peripheral eosinophilia, and peripheral neuropathy. Only 40% of patients produce detectable ANCA. The overall prevalence of EGPA in European populations has been estimated to range from 2 to 38 cases per million</ns0:p><ns0:p>Prior to the use of alkylating agents, survival with these diseases was quite poor (e.g., median survival of patients with GPA was ~5 months)</ns0:p><ns0:p>The Voting Panel was assembled for the ACR and Vasculitis Foundation's broad effort to develop recommendations for 7 forms of systemic vasculitis: giant cell arteritis, Takayasu arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa, Kawasaki syndrome, and the 3 AAVs presented in this report. The physicians on this panel included rheumatologists who could provide insight on all of these diseases and did not include other subspecialists who would not have experience with many of the other vasculitides addressed in this effort (e.g., pulmonologists who would not have experience with large-or medium-sized vessel vasculitis).</ns0:p><ns0:p>The Literature Review team chair was a nephrologist. The patients on the Voting Panel presented the views of the Patient Panel, which consisted of patients with different types of vasculitis. A recommendation required â‰¥70% consensus among the Voting Panel.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>How to interpret the recommendations</ns0:head><ns0:p>A strong recommendation is usually supported by moderateto high-quality evidence (e.g., multiple randomized controlled trials). For a strong recommendation, the recommended course of action would apply to all or almost all patients. Only a small proportion of clinicians/patients would not want to follow the recommendation. In rare instances, a strong recommendation may be based on very low-to low-certainty evidence. For example, an intervention may be strongly recommended if it is considered benign, lowcost, without harms, and the consequence of not performing the intervention may be catastrophic. An intervention may be strongly recommended against if there is high certainty that the intervention leads to more harm than the comparison with very low or low certainty about its benefit</ns0:p><ns0:p>A conditional recommendation is usually supported by lower-quality evidence or a close balance between desirable and undesirable outcomes. For a conditional recommendation, the recommended course of action would apply to the majority of the patients, but the alternative is a reasonable consideration. Conditional recommendations always warrant a shared decisionmaking approach. We specify some conditions under which the alternative may be considered.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In some instances, the committee found that the evidence for a particular PICO question did not support a graded recommendation or did not favor one intervention over the other. However, the Voting Panel believed that the PICO question addressed a commonly encountered clinical question and thus felt that providing guidance for this question was warranted. For these situations, we present "ungraded position statements," which reflect general views of the Voting Panel.</ns0:p><ns0:p>In this evidence-based guideline, we explicitly used the best evidence available and present it for the clinician and reader</ns0:p><ns0:p>For each recommendation, details regarding the PICO questions and the GRADE evidence tables can be found in Supplementary Appendix 2 (<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24634/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/10. 1002/acr.24634/ abstract</ns0:ref>).</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>RESULTS</ns0:head><ns0:p>For the evidence report for GPA and MPA, the Literature Review team reviewed 729 articles to address 47 PICO questions. For the evidence report for EGPA, 190 articles were reviewed to address 34 PICO questions.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Recommendations and ungraded position statements for GPA and MPA</ns0:head><ns0:p>GPA and MPA are recognized as different diseases for which disease-specific management approaches exist. However, many recommendations and ungraded position statements consider GPA and MPA together, because pivotal trials have enrolled both groups and presented results for these diseases together. Therefore, we present recommendations and ungraded position statements applicable to both GPA and MPA as well as recommendations and ungraded position statements only applicable to GPA. All recommendations for GPA/MPA are conditional, due in part to a lack of multiple randomized controlled trials supporting the recommendations. The complete list of studies reviewed to form the recommendations is provided in the evidence report (Supplementary Appendix 2,<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24634/abstract">http://onlin elibr ary.wiley.com/doi/ 10. 1002/ acr.24634/ abstract</ns0:ref>). Given that these diseases affect multiple organ systems, collaboration between rheumatologists, ne phrologists, pulmonologists, and otolaryngologists can enhance the care of patients with GPA and MPA.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ns0:ref>presents the definitions of selected terms used in the recommendations and ungraded position statements, including the definition of severe and nonsevere disease and the dosing regimens of medications used for remission induction and maintenance.

Figure<ns0:ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ns0:ref>presents key recommendations for the treatment of GPA and MPA.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Remission induction for active, severe disease</ns0:head><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with active, severe GPA/MPA, we conditionally recommend treatment with rituximab over cyclophosphamide for remission induction.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Both rituximab and cyclophosphamide, in combination with glucocorticoids, have been used for remission induction in GPA and MPA. Rituximab has been shown to provide similar benefits to cyclophosphamide for remission induction in a randomized controlled trial</ns0:p><ns0:p>Cyclophosphamide (dosing provided in Table<ns0:ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ns0:ref>) may be used when rituximab needs to be avoided or when patients have active disease despite receiving rituximab treatment. It remains controversial whether cyclophosphamide should be preferred for certain types of severe disease, such as acute renal failure (e.g., serum creatinine &gt;4.0 mg/dl). Either intravenous (IV) pulse or daily oral cyclophosphamide can be used</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation: In patients with GPA/MPA with active glomerulonephritis, we conditionally recommend against the routine addition of plasma exchange to remission induction therapy.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Plasma exchange should not be initiated in all patients with active glomerulonephritis but can be considered for patients at higher risk of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who accept a potential increased risk of infection.</ns0:p><ns0:p>This recommendation is supported by data from the 2 largest trials of plasma exchange for the treatment of glomerulonephritis in AAV. The first trial, which required a serum creatinine level of â‰¥5.8 mg/ dl for entry, showed that plasma exchange decreased the risk of ESRD but did not decrease mortality</ns0:p><ns0:p>However, combined data from these 2 trials show that there is probably a decreased risk of ESRD in patients with glomerulonephritis who received plasma exchange, compared to those who did not (hazard ratio 0.72 [95% CI 0.53-0.98]; moderate certainty) (Supplementary Appendix 2,<ns0:ref type="url" target="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24634/abstract">http://onlin e libr ary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acr.24634/ abstract</ns0:ref>). The benefit was most pronounced in patients with the highest risk of ESRD (118 fewer cases of ESRD per 1,000 cases of active glomerulonephritis [95% CI between 217 and 7 fewer cases]), although no difference in mortality was demonstrated (risk ratio 1.15 [95% CI 0.78-1.70]; moderate certainty). In 4 trials of plasma exchange in AAV, a higher risk of severe infection was observed with plasma exchange (risk ratio 1.19 [95% CI 0.99-1.42]; moderate certainty).</ns0:p><ns0:p>These findings suggest that for patients with a low risk of progression to ESRD, the risk of plasma exchange may outweigh the benefit; however, in patients with a higher risk of progression to ESRD, the decrease in risk could outweigh the increased risk of serious infection with plasma exchange. Therefore, the Voting Panel does not recommend plasma exchange for all patients with active glomerulonephritis but favors consideration of the treatment for patients at a higher risk of progression to ESRD. Factors that could influence whether plasma exchange is initiated include the patient's kidney function upon presentation, rate of loss of kidney function, response to remission induction therapies, and the patient's ability to tolerate serious infections.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Recommendation/statement</ns0:head></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>PICO question informing recommendation and discussion</ns0:head><ns0:p>Level of evidence Treatment of sinonasal, airway, and mass lesions Ungraded position statement: For patients with sinonasal involvement in GPA, nasal rinses and topical nasal therapies (antibiotics, lubricants, and GCs) may be beneficial.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>36, 37, 38, 39 Very low to low</ns0:head><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with GPA in remission who have nasal septal defects and/or nasal bridge collapse, we conditionally recommend reconstructive surgery, if desired by the patient.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head n="45">Low</ns0:head><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with GPA and actively inflamed subglottic and/or endobronchial tissue with stenosis, we conditionally recommend treating with immunosuppressive therapy over surgical dilation with intralesional GC injection alone.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head n="40">Low</ns0:head><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with GPA and mass lesions (e.g., orbital pseudotumor or masses of the parotid glands, brain, or lungs), we conditionally recommend treatment with immunosuppressive therapy over surgical removal of the mass lesion with immunosuppressive therapy.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>41, 42 Very low to low</ns0:head></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Other considerations</ns0:head><ns0:p>Recommendation: In patients with GPA/MPA, we conditionally recommend against dosing immunosuppressive therapy based on ANCA titer results alone.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head n="1">Very low</ns0:head><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with GPA who are receiving rituximab or cyclophosphamide, we conditionally recommend prophylaxis to prevent Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head n="43">Low</ns0:head><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with GPA/MPA in remission and stage 5 chronic kidney disease, we conditionally recommend evaluation for renal transplantation.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head n="46">Low</ns0:head><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with active GPA/MPA who are unable to receive other immunomodulatory therapy, we conditionally recommend administering IVIG.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head n="32">Low</ns0:head><ns0:p>Ungraded position statement: The optimal duration of anticoagulation is unknown for patients with GPA/MPA who experience venous thrombotic events.

Overall, patients expressed a desire to minimize the glucocorticoid dose as much as possible but recognized that some patients may require low-dose glucocorticoids long-term to maintain disease quiescence.

We recommend switching to the other remission induction agent prior to using combination therapy.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with GPA/MPA that is refractory to remission induction therapy, we conditionally recommend adding IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) to current therapy.</ns0:p><ns0:p>IVIG should not be used routinely to treat GPA/MPA but can be considered at certain treatment doses (e.g., 2 gm/kg) as adjunctive therapy for short-term control, while waiting for remission induction therapy (i.e., rituximab or cyclophosphamide) to become effective (see above recommendation)</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Treatment of sinonasal, airway, and mass lesions</ns0:head><ns0:p>Ungraded position statement: For patients with sinonasal involvement in GPA, nasal rinses and topical nasal therapies (antibiotics, lubricants, and glucocorticoids) may be beneficial.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We suggest collaborating with an otolaryngologist with expertise in treating GPA to determine whether these interventions should be used.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with GPA in remission who have nasal septal defects and/or nasal bridge collapse, we conditionally recommend reconstructive surgery, if desired by the patient.</ns0:p><ns0:p>To optimize surgical outcomes, reconstructive surgery should be performed, after a period of sustained remission, by an otolaryngologist with expertise in treating GPA</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with GPA and actively inflamed subglottic and/or endobronchial tissue with stenosis, we conditionally recommend treating with immunosuppressive therapy over surgical dilation with intralesional glucocorticoid injection alone.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Subglottic or endobronchial stenoses should be managed by an otolaryngologist or pulmonologist, respectively, with expertise in management of these lesions.

In either instance, glucocorticoids should be combined with a nonglucocorticoid immunosuppressive agent such as cyclophosphamide or rituximab (see ungraded position statement below).</ns0:p><ns0:p>Ungraded position statement: For patients with active, severe EGPA, either cyclophosphamide or rituximab may be prescribed for remission induction.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Cyclophosphamide has been more commonly used for remission induction in patients with active, severe EGPA, given the experience with cyclophosphamide in other forms of vasculitis</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with active, severe EGPA, we conditionally recommend treatment with cyclo phosphamide or rituximab over mepolizumab for remission induction.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The efficacy of mepolizumab in severe EGPA has not been established, as patients with active, severe disease were excluded from the randomized trial</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Remission induction for active, nonsevere disease</ns0:head><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with active, nonsevere EGPA, we conditionally recommend initiating treatment with mepolizumab and glucocorticoids over methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids.</ns0:p><ns0:p>A range of immunosuppressive agents may be considered in the treatment of active, nonsevere EGPA, all of which are used with glucocorticoids. The clinical profile of nonsevere EGPA includes predominantly asthma, sinus disease, and nonsevere vasculitis. While there is significant clinical experience with methotrexate, azathioprine, and mycophenolate mofetil, there are limited data regarding their efficacy, and these treatments have not been assessed in randomized clinical trials. The GRADE methodology used in the guideline development process weights clinical trials more heavily than observational studies. Thus, mepolizumab is recommended as the first choice, because it has been found to be efficacious for nonsevere EGPA in a randomized trial</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with active, nonsevere EGPA, we conditionally recommend initiating treatment with methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids over glucocorticoids alone.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Patients should be treated with adjunctive methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil rather than glucocorticoids alone in order to minimize glucocorticoid toxicity. One randomized trial that combined patients with EGPA, MPA, and polyarteritis nodosa without poor prognosis factors showed that the addition of azathioprine did not provide benefit beyond glucocorticoids alone</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>| 1101</ns0:head><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with active, nonsevere EGPA, we conditionally recommend initiating treatment with methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil and glucocorticoids over cyclophosphamide or rituximab and glucocorticoids.</ns0:p><ns0:p>While the comparative efficacy of methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab is not well established, the use of methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil is favored, based on more experience with these agents in EGPA compared to rituximab. However, rituximab may be considered if other agents are not effective in controlling active, nonsevere disease, or if the patient has nonsevere vasculitis (which in some series included mononeuritis multiplex) and is positive for ANCA. Cyclophosphamide should be avoided when treating active, nonsevere disease due to its toxicity and is the least preferred option in this setting.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Remission maintenance</ns0:head><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with severe EGPA whose disease has entered remission with cyclophosphamide therapy, we conditionally recommend treatment with methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil over rituximab for remission maintenance.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Typically, a maintenance agent would be used after remission induction in severe EGPA to reduce toxicity and the risk of disease relapse , although monophasic disease can occur</ns0:p><ns0:p>Use of methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil is recommended over rituximab, because there has been less experience with the use of rituximab for remission maintenance in EGPA. Rituximab could be considered if remission were induced with rituximab or if there are contraindications to other choices.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with severe EGPA whose disease has entered remission, we conditionally recommend treatment with methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil over mepolizumab for remission maintenance.</ns0:p><ns0:p>While there are limited data informing the use of remission maintenance therapy in EGPA, remission induction therapies (e.g., cyclophosphamide) should not be indefinitely continued given the potential toxicity. Thus, methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil can be considered for remission maintenance based on experience in GPA/MPA, expert opinion, and results from small studies</ns0:p><ns0:p>Ungraded position statement: The duration of glucocorticoid therapy in EGPA should be guided by the patient's clinical condition, values, and preferences.</ns0:p><ns0:p>There is insufficient published evidence to support a specific duration of glucocorticoid treatment, and thus, the length of glucocorticoid therapy should be determined based on each patient's clinical circumstances. Many patients with EGPA require some treatment with glucocorticoids, generally at a low dose, to maintain control of asthma and allergy symptoms. The minimum effective dose should be prescribed to minimize glucocorticoid toxicity.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Treatment of disease relapse</ns0:head><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with EGPA who have experienced relapse with severe disease manifestations after prior successful remission induction with cyclophosphamide, we conditionally recommend treatment with rituximab over cyclophosphamide for remission re-induction.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Rituximab is favored based on the general desire to avoid re-treatment with cyclophosphamide if possible and on the findings of an observational study of rituximab in relapsing or refractory EGPA</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with EGPA who have experienced relapse with severe disease manifestations after prior successful remission induction with rituximab, we conditionally recommend treatment with rituximab over switching to cyclophosphamide for remission re-induction.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Re-induction of remission with rituximab is favored over cyclophosphamide treatment to minimize toxicity. However, the duration of remission prior to the onset of relapse should be examined. Cyclophosphamide should be considered if a severe relapse occurred quickly after rituximab treatment, or if cardiac involvement is present (see ungraded position statement and recommendation on this topic).</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with EGPA who have experienced relapse with nonsevere disease manifestations (asthma and/or sinonasal disease) while receiving methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil, we conditionally recommend adding mepolizumab over switching to another agent.</ns0:p><ns0:p>For patients with EGPA with active asthma, inhaled therapies should be maximized prior to increasing systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Although no direct comparative data are available, mepolizumab was found to be efficacious in a randomized trial in patients specifically described in this recommendation: those with relapsing nonsevere EGPA who are receiving immunosuppressive therapy</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with EGPA who have experienced relapse with nonsevere disease manifestations (asthma and/or sinonasal disease) while receiving low-dose glucocorticoids and no other therapy, we conditionally recommend adding mepolizumab over adding methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Similar to the discussion about the above recommendation, use of inhaled agents should be optimized in patients experiencing disease relapse with asthma and/or sinonasal disease. For patients with nonsevere relapsing EGPA who are receiving glucocorticoid monotherapy, starting mepolizumab would be preferred over adding methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil, given the treatment's proven efficacy in this population in a randomized trial</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with EGPA and high serum IgE levels who have experienced relapse with nonsevere disease manifestations (asthma and/or sinonasal disease) while receiving methotrexate, azathioprine, or mycophenolate mofetil, we conditionally recommend adding mepolizumab over adding omalizumab.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The published evidence on omalizumab, an anti-IgE antibody, in EGPA has been limited. Therefore, even for a patient with high serum IgE levels, mepolizumab is the preferred choice based on evidence from the randomized controlled trial</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>Other considerations</ns0:head><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with newly diagnosed EGPA receiving leukotriene inhibitors, we conditionally recommend continuing leukotriene inhibitors over discontinuing them.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Following the introduction of leukotriene inhibitors, concerns were raised about a link with the development of EGPA. In subsequent retrospective studies, it was not concluded that there is a causal relationship between leukotriene inhibitors and EGPA</ns0:p><ns0:p>Ungraded position statement: Use of leukotriene inhibitors is not contraindicated for patients with EGPA with active asthma and/or sinonasal disease.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Leukotriene inhibitors carry therapeutic indications for asthma and allergic rhinitis. As no clear causal association with EGPA has been demonstrated, a leukotriene inhibitor can be added to help manage asthma and sinonasal disease. However, leukotriene inhibitors are one of many options and are not the only choice in this setting. Leukotriene inhibitors should not be used to treat manifestations aside from asthma and sinonasal disease.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with EGPA, we conditionally recommend obtaining an echocardiogram at the time of diagnosis.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Cardiac involvement is the major cause of diseaserelated mortality in EGPA</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with EGPA, we conditionally recommend using the Five-Factor Score to guide therapy.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The Five-Factor Score (FFS), first published in 1996</ns0:p><ns0:p>Ungraded position statement: In patients with sinonasal involvement in EGPA, treatment with nasal rinses and topical therapies (e.g., antibiotics, lubricants, and glucocorticoids) may be considered.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Allergic rhinitis and sinonasal disease are frequent clinical features of EGPA. Although the efficacy of nasal rinses and topical | 1103 therapies in EGPA is not well established, some patients may benefit. Where possible, consultation with an otolaryngologist with expertise in treating AAV should be obtained to guide the use and choice of these agents. These interventions can continue to be beneficial even when symptoms have improved or resolved.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recommendation: For patients with EGPA who are receiving cyclophosphamide or rituximab, we conditionally recommend prescribing medications for prophylaxis to prevent P jirovecii pneumonia.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Prophylaxis to prevent P jirovecii pneumonia is discussed above in the GPA/MPA recommendations. The same considerations regarding prophylaxis to prevent this condition in patients with GPA/MPA apply to those with EGPA.</ns0:p></ns0:div><ns0:div><ns0:head>DISCUSSION</ns0:head><ns0:p>In this guideline, we present the first ACR/Vasculitis Foundation recommendations for the management of GPA, MPA, and EGPA. Although these recommendations provide a general guide for disease management, the patient's clinical condition, preferences, and values should influence their treatment. Overall, these recommendations reflect the evolving management of these diseases, including the new roles for biologic therapies and aggressive strategies to minimize glucocorticoid toxicity. The recommendations for GPA and MPA are supported by a greater number of randomized trials than are currently available in EGPA. All of the recommendations made for these 3 diseases are conditional, which indicates that there are settings in which the evidence is not strong or an alternative is a reasonable consideration. These recommendations should not be used by any agency to restrict access to therapy or require that certain therapies be utilized prior to other therapies.</ns0:p><ns0:p>The physicians on the Voting Panel were primarily rheumatologists, because the recommendations were being developed for rheumatologists in the US. Since AAVs are multisystem diseases, patients with AAVs often receive care from other medical subspecialists (e.g., nephrologists, pulmonologists, and/or otolaryngologists). While the recommendations presented in this guideline are driven by the published data, other medical subspecialists may favor a different management strategy. We encourage rheumatologists to discuss treatment plans and coordinate care with other subspecialists as needed.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Recently, a clinical trial of avacopan in patients with GPA and MPA was published</ns0:p><ns0:p>This guideline highlights gaps in our knowledge for the treatment of AAV. Most glaring is the lack of biomarker assessments or other noninvasive diagnostic testing with minimal toxicity that can accurately assess disease activity and predict outcomes. In addition, while we have evidence from randomized clinical trials to support recommendations regarding initial remission induction and maintenance therapy, critical questions remain unanswered, such as the optimal duration of therapy.</ns0:p><ns0:p>These gaps in knowledge reinforce the need for ongoing research in these diseases. Specific areas to investigate include the following: 1) biomarker studies to identify more specific, reliable indicators of disease activity that can guide treatment decisions; 2) trials to clarify how best to use the currently available medications (e.g., dosing, duration, effective combinations, and in which population to use which drugs); 3) trials to identify novel, targeted, and/or glucocorticoid-sparing agents with minimal toxicity; and 4) long-term studies to understand the course of disease and the safety of current therapies.</ns0:p><ns0:p>We hope significant progress will be made in these areas such that future recommendations provide a more tailored approach to disease management, minimize treatment toxicity, and prevent organ damage in these patients.</ns0:p><ns0:p>Seo, Stone, Vitobaldi, Warner, Byram, Dua, Husainat, Kalot, Lin, Springer, Turgunbaev, Mustafa.</ns0:p></ns0:div></ns0:body><ns0:back>
